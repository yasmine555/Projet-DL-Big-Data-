Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are metabolic byproducts that are necessary for physiological function but 
can be toxic at high levels. 

[CHUNK 1]
Levels of these oxidative stressors increase gradually throughout the lifespan, 
impairing mitochondrial function and damaging all parts of the body, particularly the central nervous 
system. 

[CHUNK 2]
Emerging evidence suggests that accumulated oxidative stress may be one of the key mecha- 
nisms causing cognitive aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

[CHUNK 3]
Here, 
we synthesize the current literature on the effect of neuronal oxidative stress on mitochondrial dysfunc- 
tion, DNA damage and epigenetic changes related to cognitive aging and AD. 

[CHUNK 4]
We further describe how 
oxidative stress therapeutics such as antioxidants, caloric restriction and physical activity can reduce ox- 
idation and prevent cognitive decline in brain aging and AD. 

[CHUNK 5]
Of the currently available therapeutics, we 
propose that long term physical activity is the most promising avenue for improving cognitive health by 
reducing ROS while promoting the low levels required for optimal function.

Introduction 
In 1954, Denham Harman proposed that free radical reactions 
“may be involved in production of the aging changes associated 
with the environment, disease and an intrinsic aging process”
( Harman, 1992 ). 

[CHUNK 9]
Time has conﬁrmed that free radicals are heavily 
involved in the aging process, as well as diseases associated with 
advanced age such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ( Butterﬁeld and

2017 ). 

[CHUNK 14]
As the population continues to age, cases of this tragic dis- 
ease will increase, making it critical to ﬁnd effective therapies for 
age-associated oxidative stress. 


[CHUNK 15]
Harman’s free radical theory of aging is most relevant to the 
central nervous system, which consumes 20% of the body’s oxy- 
gen and is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress ( Bonda et al., 
2014 ). 

[CHUNK 16]
Neurons are especially sensitive since they are non-dividing, 
post mitotic cells and cannot be replaced in the event of dam- 
age, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction late in their lifespan 
( Grimm and Eckert, 2017 ; Wang and Michaelis, 2010 ). 

[CHUNK 17]
Addition- 
ally, mitochondria in presynaptic terminals are exposed to high 
levels of calcium insult from voltage gated calcium channels, ac- 
celerating synaptic oxidative damage ( Grimm and Eckert, 2017 ). 


[CHUNK 18]
The brain’s susceptibility to oxidative stress leads to an increase 
in oxidative biomarkers with age, including toxic levels of met- 
als, DNA damage and deﬁcits in protein metabolism ( Grimm and 
Eckert, 2017 ; Mecocci et al., 2018 ; Thanan et al., 2014 ;). 

[CHUNK 19]
The AD 
brain is also marked by excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
bioactive metals such as copper, iron, zinc and magnesium, which 
can promote the aggregation of amyloid beta into plaques and hy- 
perphosphorylated tau into neuroﬁbrillary tangles ( Jomova et al., 
2010 ; Kim et al., 2018 ; Wang and Wang, 2017 ; Tönnies and 
Trushina, 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 20]
In this paper, we will review recent literature on 
the role of oxidative stress in the progression of aging and AD, be-

ginning with the production of ROS as byproducts of mitochon- 
drial respiration. 

[CHUNK 24]
We will then discuss the effects of these oxida- 
tive stressors on DNA through both direct and epigenetic manipu- 
lations. 

[CHUNK 25]
Lastly, we will examine current therapeutics for oxidative 
stress (antioxidants, caloric restriction mimetics and physical ac- 
tivity) and their ability to reduce oxidation in the aged and de- 
generated brain. 

[CHUNK 26]
We conclude that long term physical activity is 
an eﬃcient means of reducing oxidative stress in the brain while 
maintaining physiologically necessary low levels of oxidation. 


[CHUNK 27]
2. 

[CHUNK 28]
Oxidative stress is a byproduct of mitochondrial respiration 
Mitochondria are the main hub of neuronal oxidative stress, as 
most free radicals are generated as byproducts of the mitochon- 
drial electron transport chain. 

[CHUNK 29]
Superoxide is a byproduct of mito- 
chondrial respiration which is produced from oxygen when there is 
an excess of ATP and electron transport is diminished ( Sinha et al., 
2013 ). 

[CHUNK 30]
Superoxide dismutase can then convert superoxide to hy- 
drogen peroxide, which is further broken down into hydroxyl rad- 
icals and anions by the Fenton reaction ( Singh et al., 2019 ). 

[CHUNK 31]
Mito- 
chondrial ROS can lead to redox imbalance, neurotoxicity, genomic 
instability, pro-inﬂammatory gene transcription and cytokine re- 
lease, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF alpha ( Islam, 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 32]
In a positive 
feedback cycle, ROS species can damage and inactivate parts of the 
electron transport chain, leading to increased electron reduction of 
oxygen to superoxide ( Islam, 2017 ; Sies et al., 2017 ; Sinha et al., 
2013 ). 

[CHUNK 33]
Mitochondrial ROS are particularly damaging to mitochon- 
drial DNA (mtDNA), which are not protected by histones and mu- 
tate at a higher rate. 

[CHUNK 34]
The frequent damage to mtDNA severely im- 
pairs the function of postmitotic neurons, making removal of dam- 
aged mitochondria via mitophagy critical ( Islam, 2017 : Lee et al., 
2012 ). 

[CHUNK 35]
Mitophagy is the degradation of mitochondria due to signals 
such as starvation or oxidative stress. 

[CHUNK 36]
Oxidative stress can induce 
mitophagy by decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential 
but can also impair mitophagy by interacting with its regulators. 


[CHUNK 37]
Parkin, a key mitophagy regulator involved in Parkinson’s disease, 
can be S nitrosylated by ROS, inhibiting it and preventing the re- 
moval of damaged mitochondria ( Lee et al., 2012 ). 

[CHUNK 38]
The central role 
of mitochondria in ROS production has led to a working theory 
of aging that combines ROS, DNA damage and mitochondrial the- 
ories ( Maynard et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 39]
The theory posits that DNA damage 
activates kinases and PARP, which deplete NAD + levels, a cofac- 
tor for many metabolic pathways and a donor in the production 
of ATP. 

[CHUNK 40]
A reduction in NAD + increases the need for oxygen con- 
sumption and ATP production, causing mitochondria to couple in 
an attempt to meet high energy demands. 

[CHUNK 41]
Mitochondrial coupling 
increases membrane potential, decreases mitophagy, and elevates 
free radicals, the last of which causes further DNA damage ( Fig. 

[CHUNK 42]
1 ; 
Guillaumet-Adkins et al., 2017 ; Maynard et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 43]
The close re- 
lationship between harmful ROS and mitochondria lends weight to 
the hypothesis that mitochondria play a critical role in aging and 
associated neurodegenerative diseases. 


[CHUNK 44]
2.1. 

[CHUNK 45]
Mitochondrial oxidative stress and dysfunction increase in the 
aged brain 
Mitochondrial dysfunction is prevalent in aging and improv- 
ing mitochondrial function can have far reaching effects on sys- 
temic age-associated oxidative stress. 

[CHUNK 46]
In healthy aging, there are 
marked deﬁcits in mitochondrial metabolism, speciﬁcally a reduc- 
tion in the α subunit of the mitochondrial F1 ATP synthase, which 
couples oxidative phosphorylation to ATP synthesis. 

[CHUNK 47]
This leads 
to decreased ATP production, increased ROS production and in- 
creased DNA, protein and lipid oxidation ( Grimm and Eckert, 2017 ; 
Lu et al., 2004 ; Mecocci et al., 2018 ). 

[CHUNK 48]
Mitochondrial impairment 
leads not only to mtDNA damage but nuclear DNA damage as 
well, particularly in the promoter region of age-downregulated 
genes involved with vesicular function, synaptic plasticity and mi- 
tochondrial function ( Lu et al., 2004 ). 

[CHUNK 49]
Antioxidant overexpression 
has been tested as a potential means of mitigating the delete- 
rious effects of age but has proven ineffective in extending the 
lifespan except in superoxide dismutase (SOD) overexpressing ﬂies 
( Pérez et al., 2009 ; Tower, 2000 ). 

[CHUNK 50]
However, overexpression of mito- 
chondrial catalase (mCAT) signiﬁcantly extends the mouse lifespan. 


[CHUNK 51]
Mitochondrial catalase overexpression provides additional bene- 
ﬁts including an overall reduction in oxidation, preserved insulin 
signaling and delayed cardiac and cataract pathology ( Dai et al., 
2009 ; Paglialunga et al., 2015 ; Schriner et al., 2005 ). 

[CHUNK 52]
DNA dam- 
age was similarly reduced in mCAT mice, both in aged skeletal 
muscle and mtDNA from asbestos exposed lungs ( Campisi et al., 
2019 ; Kim et al., 2016 ; Schriner et al., 2005 ). 

[CHUNK 53]
These ﬁndings suggest 
that mCAT mice might prevent DNA damage in other tissue types, 
and in nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA. 

[CHUNK 54]
A focused increase 
in mitochondrial catalase effectively mitigates oxidative stress, in- 
dicating the critical role of mitochondria in regulating ROS with 
age. 


[CHUNK 55]
2.2. 

[CHUNK 56]
Mitochondrial oxidative stress is a central cause of Alzheimer’s 
disease 
Dysfunctional mitochondria are also implicated in the patho- 
genesis of AD, as one of the ﬁrst markers of AD is increased mtDNA 
oxidation ( Grimm and Eckert, 2017 ; Mecocci et al., 2018 ). 

[CHUNK 57]
In fact, 
age-associated mitochondrial decline may be one of the ﬁrst events 
in the pathogenesis of sporadic, late onset AD. 

[CHUNK 58]
The mitochondrial 
cascade hypothesis states that age-associated loss of mitochon- 
drial function affects the expression and processing of APP, pro- 
ducing amyloid beta oligomers that accumulate into plaques in 
Alzheimer’s disease ( Swerdlow et al., 2014 ; Cheignon et al., 2018 ). 


[CHUNK 59]
Our lab was the ﬁrst to show that the hydrophobic 25-35 re- 
gion of amyloid beta leads to neuronal toxicity, and the Matt- 
son group further demonstrated that it generates reactive oxy- 
gen species, demonstrating that amyloid beta is itself an effec- 
tive source of oxidative stress ( Hensley et al., 1994 ; Pike et al., 
1992 ). 

[CHUNK 60]
It was later discovered that incubating neurons with amy- 
loid beta 1-42 oligomers leads to lipid peroxidation as marked 
by protein bound 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (HNE) ( Mark et al., 
1997 ). 

[CHUNK 61]
The hydrophobic nature of amyloid beta allows it to reside 
in the lipid bilayer, and covalent bonding of HNE to neuronal pro- 
teins leads to cell death ( Butterﬁeld, 2020 ; Di Domenico et al., 
2017 ; Pike et al., 1993 ). 

[CHUNK 62]
Amyloid beta induced-HNE further im- 
pairs glucose and glutamate transporters, decreases mitochondrial 
transmembrane potential and reduces the activity of the sodium- 
potassium ATPase (Keller and Mark et al., 1997 ; Keller and Pang 
et al., 1997 ). 

[CHUNK 63]
The oxidative stress caused by amyloid beta is likely 
due to the complexes it forms with redox active metals. 

[CHUNK 64]
Copper, 
zinc and iron all bind to amyloid beta, promoting its aggregation 
into plaques. 

[CHUNK 65]
Of these metals, copper forms the most stable bond, 
and this complex has been shown to generate superoxide and hy- 
drogen peroxide ( Cheignon et al., 2018 ; Reybier et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 66]
The 
oxidative stress caused by metal-amyloid complexes lead to exci- 
totoxicity, promotes membrane depolarization and impairs mito- 
chondrial function. 


[CHUNK 67]
Mitochondrial dysfunction in the AD brain is further exacer- 
bated by impaired glucose metabolism, insulin production and mi- 
tophagy. 

[CHUNK 68]
Brain glucose metabolism is reduced prior to the onset of 
AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a pre-clinical 
stage of the disease ( Tönnies and Trushina, 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 69]
The AD brain is 
further marked by an upregulation of the transcriptional repressor 
AEBP1 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1), which down reg-

[CHUNK 73]
Combined Theory of Aging. 

[CHUNK 74]
This theory combines the DNA damage, mitochondrial and free radical theories of aging. 

[CHUNK 75]
DNA damage activates kinases and PARP, which 
consume NAD + . 

[CHUNK 76]
The decline in NAD + increases energy production needs, elevating oxygen consumption and ATP production. 

[CHUNK 77]
Compensatory mitochondrial coupling leads to 
increased membrane potential, a decline in mitophagy and higher levels of free radicals, which further elevate DNA damage. 


[CHUNK 78]
ulates the insulin producing enzymes PCSK1 and PCSK2 (propro- 
tein convertase 1 and 2). 

[CHUNK 79]
Downregulation of the insulin receptor 
MET causes further insulin resistance, leading to downstream mi- 
tochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impair- 
ments ( Abolhassani et al., 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 80]
Mitophagy dynamics are also im- 
paired in AD, as the mitochondrial ﬁssion protein DRP1(dynamin- 
related protein 1) is S-nitrosylated and hyperactivated by high 
levels of amyloid beta peptide, leading to excessive mitochon- 
drial breakdown and synaptic damage ( Nakamura et al., 2010 ). 

[CHUNK 81]
Re- 
cent studies have shown that the damaging effects of mitochon- 
drial dysfunction can be mitigated, attenuating the pathogenesis 
of AD. 

[CHUNK 82]
Overexpression of the mitophagy regulator parkin in 3xTg 
mice reduced amyloid beta accumulation and damaged mitochon- 
dria while restoring neurotransmitter synthesis ( Khandelwal et al., 
2011 ). 

[CHUNK 83]
In cultured ﬁbroblasts from spontaneous AD patients, over- 
expression of PARK2 was able to reverse mitophagy impairments 
by increasing autophagic vacuoles, mitochondrial targeting and mi- 
tochondrial recycling. 

[CHUNK 84]
( Mart ´ιn-Maestro et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 85]
Thus targeting 
stressed and damaged mitochondria may be a key strategy for re- 
ducing oxidative stress in models of AD. 


[CHUNK 86]
3. 

[CHUNK 87]
Types of DNA damage 
A key marker of oxidative stress is DNA damage, which leads to 
apurinic and apyrimidinic DNA sites, oxidized purines and pyrim- 
idines, and DNA breaks. 

[CHUNK 88]
These DNA breaks are either single strand 
breaks (SSBs) or double strand breaks (DSBs), with DSBs being the 
more toxic of the two. 

[CHUNK 89]
SSBs are caused by the breakdown of the 
sugar phosphate backbone of DNA following ROS oxidation, while 
DSBs are longer lasting and can lead to changes in the transcrip- 
tion of gene promoters near break sites ( Shanbhag et al., 2019 ; 
Thanan et al., 2014 ). 

[CHUNK 90]
DNA repair capacity is determined by levels 
of NAD + ; while higher levels of NAD + correlate with increased 
DNA repair, lower levels are indicative of ROS accumulation. 

[CHUNK 91]
NAD + 
activates SIRT1, which decreases oxidative stress and resultant 
DNA damage by upregulating autophagy, mitophagy and protec- 
tive histone methylation ( Bosch-Presegué et al., 2011 ; Fang et al., 
2017 ). 

[CHUNK 92]
NAD + intermediates such as nicotinamide mononucleotide 
(NMN) were also found to increase SIRT1 activity, increasing NAD + 
and MnSOD levels in turn ( de Picciotto et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 93]
While neu- 
ronal DNA is generally more vulnerable to damage than DNA in 
other cell types, mitochondrial DNA is particularly susceptible due 
to its proximity to the electron transport chain and its lack of pro- 
tective histones ( Mecocci et al., 2018 ). 


[CHUNK 94]
3.1. 

[CHUNK 95]
Double strand breaks contribute to activity dependent gene 
expression 
Double strand breaks are the most frequently quantiﬁed form of 
DNA damage due to their toxicity and the transcriptional changes 
they cause in nearby gene promoters ( Shanbhag et al., 2019 ). 

[CHUNK 96]
The 
phosphorylation of H2AX ( γ H2AX) is the ﬁrst step in the DSB re-

pair process, and a widely used marker of DSB. 

[CHUNK 99]
H3K9me3, which 
our lab has shown leads to age-associated cognitive impairment 
and represses brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), also as- 
sembles the DSB repair complex and reduces DNA damage ( Ji et al., 
2019 ; Snigdha et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 100]
H3K9me3’s seemingly contradictory 
roles have led us to hypothesize that H3K9me3 upregulation and 
resultant cognitive decline may be a compensatory mechanism for 
the increased DNA damage that occurs with age. 

[CHUNK 101]
Despite the toxic- 
ity of DSBs, they are also physiologically required for the expres- 
sion of critical immediate early genes. 

[CHUNK 102]
Neuronal stimulation can 
also lead to DSBs ( Suberbielle et al., 2013 ), particularly in the pro- 
moter regions of immediate early genes (IEGs) expressed by neu- 
ronal activity. 

[CHUNK 103]
DSB formation in IEG promoter regions is suﬃcient 
to induce their expression even in the absence of an external stim- 
ulus ( Madabhushi et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 104]
The DNA repair associated protein 
Gadd45 γ was further found to regulate expression of the IEGs Arc, 
cFOS, Npas4 and Cyr61 in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex ( Li et al., 
2019 ). 

[CHUNK 105]
Overall, emerging evidence suggests that activity dependent 
DSB formation and repair is involved in neuronal early response 
gene expression. 


[CHUNK 106]
3.2. 

[CHUNK 107]
DNA damage in the aged brain impairs cognition 
DNA damage is elevated in both healthy aged and Alzheimer’s 
diseased brains, and some theorize that unrepaired DNA dam- 
age is a root cause of the aging process ( Maynard et al., 2015 ; 
Thanan et al., 2014 ). 

[CHUNK 108]
A foundational paper by Lu, et al. 

[CHUNK 109]
found 
that the promoters of many cortical genes are downregulated with 
age, beginning after age 40 and reaching peak levels after age 
70. 

[CHUNK 110]
These downregulated genes are mainly involved in synap- 
tic plasticity, vesicular transport and mitochondrial function, in- 
dicating that DNA damage directly impairs neuronal and synap- 
tic health. 

[CHUNK 111]
Brain aging also leads to increased expression of genes 
that can compensate for age-associated deﬁcits, including genes 
involved in protein folding (heat shock protein 70 and alpha 
crystallin), antioxidant defense (nonselenium glutathione peroxi- 
dase, paraoxonase and selenoprotein P) and metal ion homeosta- 
sis. 

[CHUNK 112]
Increased expression of the base-excision repair enzymes 8- 
oxoguanine DNA glycosylase and uracil DNA glycosylase are in- 
dicative of both neuroprotective changes in gene expression as 
well as increased single strand DNA damage. 

[CHUNK 113]
Lu further exam- 
ined if promoters of downregulated genes have impaired DNA re- 
pair. 

[CHUNK 114]
Promoter reporter plasmids were damaged in vitro with H202 
and transfected into SH-SY5Y cells. 

[CHUNK 115]
After damage with H202, re- 
porters derived from promoters of age-downregulated genes had 
much lower activation rates than reporters from promoters of age- 
stable genes. 

[CHUNK 116]
This indicates that age-downregulated genes have re- 
duced base excision repair, indicating an increase in single strand 
breaks. 

[CHUNK 117]
( Lu et al., 2004 ). 

[CHUNK 118]
Increased single strand breaks have also 
been observed in aged hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells 
as well as cerebellar granule cells, but not in cerebellar Purkinje 
cells ( Rutten et al., 2007 ). 

[CHUNK 119]
While DNA damage is elevated with 
age in nuclear DNA, it is 10-fold higher in mitochondrial DNA from 
subjects 42 years and older, and 15-fold higher in subjects over 
70 ( Mecocci et al., 2018 ). 

[CHUNK 120]
An elevation in age-associated single 
strand breaks impairs the expression of genes involved in synap- 
tic plasticity, learning and memory, but preferentially affects mi- 
tochondrial DNA involved in metabolism, energetics and neuron 
survival. 


[CHUNK 121]
3.3. 

[CHUNK 122]
DNA repair is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease 
AD leads to an elevation in double as well as single stranded 
breaks, suggesting that dysfunctional DNA repair may be a root 
cause of AD ( Thanan et al., 2014 ). 

[CHUNK 123]
As with normal aging, there are 
deﬁcits in the base excision repair pathway in AD ( Lovell et al., 
1999 ; Madabhushi et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 124]
The DNA damage repair pathway 
is additionally impaired by reduced recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs 
and a reduction in the levels of DSB repair proteins such as DNA 
PKcs (protein kinase catalytic subunits) and MRN complex proteins 
( Madabhushi et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 125]
γ H2AX levels are elevated in the neu- 
rons and astrocytes of MCI and AD patients, as compared to age 
matched controls ( Myung et al., 2008 ; Shanbhag et al., 2019 ). 

[CHUNK 126]
Sim- 
ilarly, the brains of hAPP mice have more neuronal DSBs than age 
matched controls before exploring a novel environment, and longer 
lasting increases in DSBs after exploration. 

[CHUNK 127]
In this study, DSBs were 
generated by physiological brain activity, but were further exacer- 
bated by the amyloid beta elevation found in this transgenic AD 
model ( Suberbielle et al., 2013 ). 

[CHUNK 128]
Our lab has previously found that 
high levels of nitrotyrosine and DNA damage precede tangle for- 
mation in the visual cortex of AD brains, suggesting that DNA dam- 
age occurs early in disease progression ( Su et al., 1997 ). 

[CHUNK 129]
Along with 
high levels of oxidative stress and DNA damage, AD is also marked 
by deﬁciencies in DNA repair mechanisms. 

[CHUNK 130]
Cerebral spinal ﬂuid 
from AD patients shows an increase in 8-OHdG in intact DNA, an 
oxidative damage marker, as well as a decrease in free 8-OHdG, 
a product of DNA repair ( Lovell et al., 1999 ). 

[CHUNK 131]
Similarly, 3xTg mice 
crossed with mice that were haploinsuﬃcient for PolB (a base ex- 
cision repair polymerase) had more cognitive deﬁcits, synapse loss 
and neuronal death, making the model more similar to human AD 
than the parent 3xTg model ( Sykora et al., 2014 ). 

[CHUNK 132]
Taken together, 
these ﬁndings indicate that DNA repair mechanisms are impaired 
as oxidative stress is elevated in AD. 

[CHUNK 133]
The severity of DNA damage 
in the AD brain greatly surpasses that in the healthy aged brain, 
suggesting that a combination of DNA damage and impaired DNA 
repair mechanisms plays a critical role in the progression of the 
disease.

Oxidative stress generates epigenetic modiﬁcations 
Recent studies have shown that oxidative stress directly af- 
fects epigenetic chromatin modiﬁcations that control how genes 
are expressed. 

[CHUNK 136]
These changes may drive physiological responses 
to oxidative stress and facilitate the progression of diseases, in- 
cluding neurodegeneration ( Kreuz, 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 137]
Oxidative stress can di- 
rectly reduce methylation of DNA by oxidizing DNA, increas- 
ing TET-mediated hydroxymethylation, and interfering with bind- 
ing of DNA methyltransferases that produce the methyl donor 
S-adenosylmethionine ( Chia et al., 2011 ; Thanan et al., 2014 ). 


[CHUNK 138]
ROS can also form oxidized DNA lesions by hydroxylating pyrim- 
idines and 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which can interfere with 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) epigenetic signals ( Guillaumet- 
Adkins et al., 2017 ; Lewandowska and Bartoszek, 2011 ). 

[CHUNK 139]
Oxida- 
tive stress alters post translational histone modiﬁcations, which 
can change chromatin structure, gene expression, gene stability 
and replication. 

[CHUNK 140]
These effects are often indirect, as ROS impair 
metabolic eﬃciency, reducing levels of metabolites such as acetyl- 
CoA, Fe, NAD + and ketoglutarate that are essential for histone- 
modifying enzymes ( Guillaumet-Adkins et al., 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 141]
H202, the 
most common means of ROS induction in vitro , has been shown 
to increase H3K9me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 while decreas- 
ing H3K9ac and H4K8ac in bronchial epithelial cells. 

[CHUNK 142]
Preincubation 
with ascorbate prevented this elevation, indicating that antioxi- 
dants can prevent ROS-induced epigenetic changes. 

[CHUNK 143]
The methyla- 
tion effects of oxidation were transient and did not persist after 
H202 washout ( Niu et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 144]
In neuronal SH-SY5Y cells, H202 
increased histone acetyltransferases and downregulated histone 
deacetylases, as well as hypomethylating APP and BACE1. 

[CHUNK 145]
H202 
thus caused the upregulation of the APP and BACE1 gene pro- 
moters, leading to amyloid beta peptide overproduction ( Gu et al.,

Repressive Histone Methylation Leads to Cognitive Decline in Aging and AD. 

[CHUNK 150]
SIRT1 stabilizes SUV39H1, the histone methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K9me3 for- 
mation. 

[CHUNK 151]
The SUV39H1 inhibitor ETP69 reduces levels of H3K9me3, while increasing BDNF, synaptic density and the performance of aged mice in an object location mem- 
ory (OLM) task. 

[CHUNK 152]
The G9a inhibitor UNC0642 has a similar effect in 5xFAD mice, reducing mono-, di- and trimethylated H3K9 along with amyloid beta plaques and 5- 
methylcytosine (5mc). 

[CHUNK 153]
Conversely, UNC0642 increases levels of antioxidants and improves OLM task performance. 

[CHUNK 154]
H3K9 methylation may underlie cognitive decline in both 
aging and AD, and the upregulation of SUV39H1 and G9a may be a compensatory response to oxidative stress. 


[CHUNK 155]
2013 ). 

[CHUNK 156]
These ﬁndings suggest that oxidative stress generates tran- 
sient epigenetic modiﬁcations which, among its wide-reaching ef- 
fects, can accelerate amyloid beta pathology. 


[CHUNK 157]
4.1. 

[CHUNK 158]
Oxidative stress upregulates H3K9 methylation 
Our group has recently begun studying the epigenetics of aging, 
in which oxidative stress plays a principal role. 

[CHUNK 159]
We have shown 
that at least 1 speciﬁc repressive epigenetic mark, H3K9me3, 
increases with age in the hippocampus. 

[CHUNK 160]
We further reduced 
H3K9me3 by inhibiting its primary catalyzing enzyme, SUV39H1, 
with a speciﬁc inhibitor (ETP69) and found that this improved 
object location memory, increased synaptic density and elevated 
BDNF levels in aged mice ( Snigdha et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 161]
Work by the Va- 
quero group suggests that oxidative stress may be one cause of 
H3K9me3 elevation. 

[CHUNK 162]
They demonstrate that oxidative stress in- 
directly increases global H3K9me3 by upregulating SIRT1, which 
protects against oxidative stress by increasing mitophagy and au- 
tophagy ( Fang et al., 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 163]
SIRT1 stabilizes the histone methyl- 
transferase SUV39H1, and SIRT1’s upregulation in turn leads to up- 
regulation of SUV39H1 and its product H3K9me3 ( Bosch-Presegué
et al., 2011 ; Vaquero et al., 2007 ). 

[CHUNK 164]
This ﬁnding suggests that the 
increase in H3K9me3 we observed in our research may in fact be 
due to a protective SIRT1 upregulation caused by oxidative stress. 

[CHUNK 165]
A 
recent paper found that inhibition of the histone methyltransferase 
G9a is similarly protective in AD mice. 

[CHUNK 166]
The G9a inhibitor UNC0642 
improved memory of objects and locations, reduced amyloid beta 
plaques, reduced 5-mc levels, and increased levels of antioxidants 
in 5XFAD mice ( Griñán-Ferré et al., 2019 ). 

[CHUNK 167]
Unlike SUV39H1, G9a 
does not speciﬁcally catalyze 1 methylated form of H3K9 but can 
produce mono- di- or tri-methylated H3K9. 

[CHUNK 168]
Other studies using 
the UNC0642 inhibitor have led to a decline in both di- and tri- 
methylated H3K9, so the speciﬁc source of the inhibitor’s effects 
cannot be parsed out ( Kim et al., 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 169]
Overall, there is emerg- 
ing evidence that the methylation of H3K9 may be upregulated by 
oxidative stress, and that inhibiting this methylation may prevent 
cognitive aging and reduce Alzheimer’s pathology ( Fig. 

[CHUNK 170]
2 ). 

[CHUNK 171]
How- 
ever, many questions remain about the different roles of methy- 
lated histones, and how oxidative stress regulates their expression.

Oxidative stress therapeutics for aging and Alzheimer’s 
disease 
5.1. 

[CHUNK 174]
Antioxidant treatment 
Perhaps the most convincing evidence that oxidative stress is 
key to brain aging and AD is the plethora of therapeutics that tar- 
get neuronal oxidative stress ( Table 1 ). 

[CHUNK 175]
The most common means of 
reducing oxidative stress is antioxidant treatment, which in some 
cases has been effective in reducing age-associated neuronal im- 
pairments and markers of neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 176]
The combination of 
Vitamins C and E (ascorbic acid and ɑ -tocopherol) has been shown 
to decrease lipid peroxidation in neuronal cells ( Li et al., 2003 ). 


[CHUNK 177]
When 24 month old Wistar rats were fed N acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), 
which increases glutathione levels in the brain, there was a coinci- 
dent reduction in ROS and inﬂammation markers such as TNF al- 
pha, IL-1 β and IL-6, as well as a protective upregulation in SIRT1 
( Garg et al., 2018 ). 

[CHUNK 178]
1 month of daily NAC and alpha-lipoic acid in- 
jections also improved the performance of SAMP8 (senescence ac- 
celerated prone 8) mice in learning and memory tasks ( Farr et al., 
2003 ). 

[CHUNK 179]
Our lab has similarly demonstrated that antioxidants are 
effective at improving performance in cognitive tasks. 

[CHUNK 180]
We found 
that supplementation with antioxidants and mitochondrial cofac- 
tors (Vitamins E and C, L-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid and 1% fruit 
and vegetable granules) improved the performance of aged beagles 
in a size and black and white discrimination task, but that this im- 
provement was greater when coupled with behavioral enrichment 
( Milgram et al., 2005 ). 

[CHUNK 181]
In humans, Vitamin E consumption from 
food and supplements was associated with a lower rate of cogni- 
tive decline in a large-scale longitudinal study, although Vitamin C 
and carnitine consumption was not ( Morris et al., 2002 ).

[CHUNK 188]
The success of antioxidants in reducing cognitive aging has 
spurred interest in their potential as AD therapeutics, although the 
results of these studies are conﬂicting. 

[CHUNK 189]
Vitamin E and mitochon- 
drial targeted antioxidants such as mitoQ and ss31 reduced oxida- 
tive stress in cultured neurons and prevented amyloid beta toxicity 
( Butterﬁeld and Halliwell, 2019 ; Manczak et al., 2010 ; Yatin et al., 
20 0 0 ). 

[CHUNK 190]
The association between antioxidants and AD in clinical 
studies is less clear. 

[CHUNK 191]
While high levels of Vitamin E in blood 
plasma generally correlate with lower risk of AD, the Conselice 
study found the prevalence of dementia was highest in those with 
higher concentrations of tocopherol ( Mecocci et al., 2018 ).

lipoic acid correlated with a reduction in Mini-Mental State Exam- 
ination scores and did not change levels of CSF (cerebral spinal 
ﬂuid) amyloid or tau ( Galasko et al., 2012 ). 

[CHUNK 195]
The PREADVISE trial 
found that neither Vitamin E nor selenium prevented AD incidence 
when taken daily for 7-12 years ( Kryscio et al., 2017 ), while the 
TEAM AD study found that daily alpha tocopherol slowed func- 
tional decline in AD patients ( Dysken et al., 2014 ; Mecocci and 
Polidori, 2012 ). 

[CHUNK 196]
Another clinical trial with 100 AD patients found 
that 8 months of drinking a polyphenol beverage reduced levels 
of homocysteine, but had no other effects ( Morillas-Ruiz et al., 
2010 ). 

[CHUNK 197]
The mixed results of antioxidant-based clinical studies may 
be due to variations in dose, timing, antioxidant combinations, 
targets and diet. 

[CHUNK 198]
Most studies with Vitamin E, for instance, use 
much more than 400 IU/day, which can be toxic. 

[CHUNK 199]
Treatment with 
antioxidants should begin long before the onset of AD symp- 
toms to be effective and should be consumed with Vitamin C or 
water-soluble electron acceptors to effectively remove ROS ( Brewer, 
2010; Jomova et al., 2010 ). 

[CHUNK 200]
Most antioxidant treatments are sys- 
temic and have poor target speciﬁcity for neuronal oxidative stres- 
sors. 

[CHUNK 201]
When diet is not also monitored, antioxidant treatment is 
not suﬃcient to counteract the effects of inﬂammatory and ox- 
idant rich foods. 

[CHUNK 202]
Consuming antioxidants through food increases 
their absorption and physiological effectiveness, indicating that an 
antioxidant-rich diet can better manage oxidative stress than sup- 
plementation ( Morris, 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 203]
A recent study showed that intake of 
ﬂavonols in the form of leafy greens, fruits, beans and tea signif- 
icantly reduced the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease, supporting 
the increased therapeutic potential of diet over supplementation 
( Holland et al., 2020 ). 

[CHUNK 204]
At present, antioxidants alone are not a use- 
ful treatment for AD, but an antioxidant rich diet may more effec- 
tively mitigate ROS induced impairments. 


[CHUNK 205]
5.2. 

[CHUNK 206]
Caloric restriction and mimetics 
Caloric restriction is another means of reducing oxidative stress 
that has also been shown to improve neuronal health and may 
protect against neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 207]
Caloric restriction is a reliable 
means of increasing lifespan, decreasing ROS levels and stimu- 
lating hormesis, subtoxic levels of oxidative stressors that pro- 
tect against more severe stressors ( Birringer, 2011 ; Coskun and 
Busciglio, 2012 ). 

[CHUNK 208]
Hormetic conditions are normally present in the 
healthy brain and lead to increased production of antioxidants, 
DNA repair enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins ( Fontana et al., 
2010 ; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 209]
Sublethal superoxide has 
even been shown to enhance neuronal plasticity by increasing long 
term potentiation in the CA1 region and stimulating neuron out- 
growth. 

[CHUNK 210]
Low levels of oxidative stress caused by caloric restriction 
also activate the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2- 
related factor 2 (Nrf2), which upregulates protective enzymes such 
as heme oxygenase and NAD(P)H-quinone oxireductase 1(NQO1) 
( Pall and Levine, 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 211]
These enzymes enable neurons to coun- 
teract more severe oxidative stressors by reducing free radicals 
(NQO1) and forming cytoprotective bilirubin (heme oxygenase 1) 
( Calabrese et al., 2010 ). 

[CHUNK 212]
Caloric restriction further increases lev- 
els of BDNF, which our lab and others have previously associated 
with ROS reduction in exercise models ( Berchtold et al., 2002 ; 
Cotman and Berchtold, 2002 ; Neeper et al., 1995 ; Neeper et al., 
1996 ; Van Cauwenberghe et al., 2016 ; Yang et al., 2014 ). 

[CHUNK 213]
However, 
long term caloric restriction is diﬃcult to implement in humans, 
and the few available clinical studies are necessarily limited in 
duration and the extent of food restriction ( Caristia et al., 2020 ). 


[CHUNK 214]
Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs), such as resveratrol, offer sim- 
ilar beneﬁts without reducing food intake ( Van Cauwenberghe 
et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 215]
CRMs are deﬁned as synthetic or natural compounds 
that mimic the metabolic, hormonal and physiological effects of 
caloric restriction. 

[CHUNK 216]
For instance, the CRM ﬁsetin, a ﬂavenoid that 
upregulates SIRT1, decreased oxidants, increased antioxidants, re- 
duced mitochondrial membrane depolarization and reduced apop- 
totic cell death in the aging rat brain ( Singh et al., 2018 ). 

[CHUNK 217]
Resvera- 
trol has also been shown to reduce oxidative stress in both neuron 
cell cultures and the mouse hippocampus. 

[CHUNK 218]
One limitation of resver- 
atrol is that it is not readily bioavailable ( Drygalski et al., 2018 ). 


[CHUNK 219]
The resveratrol analog pinostilbene is methylated to make it more 
soluble, and similarly reduces ROS in neuronal models ( Chao et al., 
2010 ). 

[CHUNK 220]
These studies suggest that caloric restriction and CRMs can 
effectively reduce neuronal oxidative stress. 


[CHUNK 221]
Although the effects of caloric restriction on age-related cogni- 
tive decline have not been thoroughly investigated, there is some 
evidence that caloric restriction can reduce neurodegeneration in 
AD. 

[CHUNK 222]
In vitro, 20μM of resveratrol in SH-SY5Y cells reduced ROS 
production, PS1, SIRT1, p53 and caspase 3, as well as levels of the 
amyloid beta producing APP and BACE ( Ko et al., 2015 ). 

[CHUNK 223]
Dietary re- 
striction also reduced amyloid beta deposition in APP transgenic 
mice ( Patel et al., 2005 ). 

[CHUNK 224]
Caloric restriction has also been used to 
treat AD in several clinical trials. 

[CHUNK 225]
In a more recent trial, intentional 
weight loss in obese elderly MCI patients was associated with cog- 
nitive improvement. 

[CHUNK 226]
This association was strongest in younger se- 
niors for memory and ﬂuency, and in APOE4 carriers for execu- 
tive function ( Horie et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 227]
In a study of the CRM resvera- 
trol, 50 0-10 0 0mg a day for 52 weeks was administered to patients 
with mild to moderate AD. 

[CHUNK 228]
Treatment reduced cognitive decline 
according to the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities 
of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL), but led to a greater decline in 
brain volume, particularly in APOE4 carriers. 

[CHUNK 229]
Treatment further re- 
duced neuroinﬂammation by reducing MMP-9, which regulates the 
permeability of the CNS, but elevated other inﬂammatory mark- 
ers such as microglia and macrophages. 

[CHUNK 230]
While the results are con- 
tradictory, the increased inﬂammation may have been a beneﬁ- 
cial adaptive immune response, and the decline in brain volume 
was not related to cognition ( Sawda et al., 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 231]
In both studies, 
changes in oxidative stressors and their downstream effectors are 
not quantiﬁed, making the role of the oxidative pathway in the ob- 
served cognitive improvements unclear ( Van Cauwenberghe et al., 
2016 ). 

[CHUNK 232]
Further clinical studies involving caloric restriction should 
measure how markers of oxidative stress change in AD patients to 
explain potentially conﬂicting changes in inﬂammation, neurode- 
generation and cognition. 


[CHUNK 233]
5.3. 

[CHUNK 234]
Physical activity 
Physical activity is a proven means of improving learning and 
memory by increasing levels of BDNF ( Berchtold et al., 2002 ; 
Cotman and Berchtold, 2002 ; Neeper et al., 1995 ; Neeper et al., 
1996 ;). 

[CHUNK 235]
Similar to caloric restriction, exercise promotes hormesis 
and Nrf2 induction, as it protects against oxidative damage through 
a BDNF mediated pathway while increasing free radicals ( Pall and 
Levine, 2015 ) . 

[CHUNK 236]
Exercise induced BDNF activates CREB, which upreg- 
ulates APE1, involved in the base excision repair pathway. 

[CHUNK 237]
Through 
increased BDNF, physical activity protects neurons from oxidative 
DNA damage by enhancing DNA repair ( Yang et al., 2014 ). 

[CHUNK 238]
At the 
same time, contracting muscles produce free radicals to promote 
the exercise training response, including activating PGC1 alpha, in- 
volved in exercise induced BDNF elevation. 

[CHUNK 239]
Endurance exercise also 
increases the amount of antioxidant enzymes in cardiac and skele- 
tal muscles ( Powers et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 240]
Physical activity thus signals the 
brain to compensate for exercise induced ROS by producing addi- 
tional neuroprotective factors. 


[CHUNK 241]
The length of an exercise program is the determining factor in 
its eﬃcacy as an oxidative stress therapeutic. 

[CHUNK 242]
While short term 
exercise tends to increase ROS, long term exercise increases an-

tioxidant enzymes, reducing overall oxidative stress ( Belviranh and 
Gökbel, 2006 ). 

[CHUNK 245]
When 12-month-old female Wistar rats were exer- 
cised for 15 weeks on a treadmill at moderate intensity, hippocam- 
pal levels of ROS decreased while levels of PGC1 alpha, phospho- 
adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (p-AMPK), SOD1, SOD2 
and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) increased ( Marosi et al., 2012 ). 

[CHUNK 246]
In 
a clinical study, long term exercise decreased advanced oxidation 
protein products (AOPP) in the blood of older adults who engaged 
in aerobic exercise 3 times a week for 6 months ( Rytz et al., 2020 ). 


[CHUNK 247]
Exercise has even been shown to accelerate DNA repair. 

[CHUNK 248]
A recent 
study of sedentary and active male volunteers found that while all 
participants had radiation induced DNA damage, trained individu- 
als had more rapid repair of radiation-induced DNA strand breaks 
after exhaustive exercise. 

[CHUNK 249]
In addition, exhaustive exercise only pro- 
duced DNA strand breaks in the lymphocytes of sedentary individ- 
uals ( Moreno-Villanueva et al., 2019 ).

Long term exercise was also shown to reduce oxidative stress 
in models of AD. 

[CHUNK 251]
When 12-month-old 3xTgAD female mice had 
access to a running wheel for 3 months, levels of lipoperoxide, 
glutathione disulﬁde (GSSG), GPX and glutathione reductase (GR) 
were reduced to control levels while the antioxidant CuZn-SOD 
was increased. 

[CHUNK 252]
A network analysis showed that this reduction in 
oxidative stress was central to other behavioral and pathological 
changes, such as improved spatial memory, reduced amyloid beta 
and p-tau, and reduced anxiety ( García-Mesa et al., 2016 ). 

[CHUNK 253]
Similar 
ﬁndings were reported in a streptozotocin (STZ) induced rat model 
of AD that were exercised on a treadmill for 4 weeks. 

[CHUNK 254]
The rats dis- 
played a reduction in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
amyloid beta and p-tau ( Lu et al., 2017 ). 

[CHUNK 255]
These studies both demon- 
strate that the reduction in neurodegeneration observed with ex- 
ercise is at least partially due to a reduction in oxidative stress. 

[CHUNK 256]
A 
recent paper suggests that long term exercise does not intrinsically 
reduce oxidative stress, but rather makes the brain more resilient 
to other stressors. 

[CHUNK 257]
8 to 9-month-old Lewis rats were treated with 
rotenone, a pesticide that inhibits complex 1 of the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain to mimic sporadic neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 258]
By itself, 6 
weeks of exercise increased hydrogen peroxide in the motor cor- 
tex of these rats. 

[CHUNK 259]
However, in the presence of rotenone, exercise 
reduced hydrogen peroxide and increased the activity of the an- 
tioxidant GPX. 

[CHUNK 260]
Additionally, prior exercise training reduced hydro- 
gen peroxide levels in the spinal cords of both DMSO and rotenone 
exposed rats ( Melo et al., 2019 ). 

[CHUNK 261]
In the presence of age, toxins, or 
neurodegeneration, long term exercise reduces oxidative stress and 
helps restore homeostatic conditions in the damaged brain.

Conclusion 
Oxidative stress plays a key role in the progression of brain 
aging and Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 264]
Mitochondria produce free radicals 
as a byproduct of respiration and are dysfunctional in both aging 
and AD. 

[CHUNK 265]
The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis posits that dam- 
aged mitochondria increase the production of amyloid beta, which 
is itself a toxic oxidative stressor. 

[CHUNK 266]
Mitochondrial antioxidants in 
aged mice reduce oxidative stress and DNA damage, while restor- 
ing mitophagy in AD models can minimize pathology. 

[CHUNK 267]
Free radicals 
lead to DNA damage, the majority of which occurs in unprotected, 
histone free mitochondrial DNA. 

[CHUNK 268]
The severe elevation in double 
strand breaks in the AD brain far exceeds the damage in the aged 
brain, and dysfunctional DNA repair further contributes to disease 
progression. 

[CHUNK 269]
Oxidative stress can even manipulate the epigenome 
and has wide reaching effects ranging from repression of cogni- 
tive genes by H3K9me3 to hypomethylation and activation of the 
APP promoter. 

[CHUNK 270]
While oxidative stress may not be the only cause of 
mental decline or neurodegeneration, it clearly contributes to the 
dysfunctional pathways associated with brain aging. 


[CHUNK 271]
Emerging therapeutics targeting oxidative stress vary in their 
ability to improve cognition and reduce ROS levels. 

[CHUNK 272]
Antioxidant 
treatments have mixed effects on cognition in both aged and AD 
patients, and dosage, timing, antioxidant combinations and diet 
must be carefully considered to produce consistent beneﬁts. 

[CHUNK 273]
Caloric 
restriction mimetics such as resveratrol have been shown to reduce 
neuronal oxidative stress in rodent and neuronal models, and even 
reduced cognitive decline in studies of MCI and AD patients; how- 
ever, the clinical effects of mimetics on brain aging have not been 
extensively studied. 

[CHUNK 274]
Long term caloric restriction is challenging for 
most people and its effects on cognitive aging have not been well 
investigated. 

[CHUNK 275]
Clinical trials are necessarily limited in duration and 
extent of food restriction, and studies using CRMs have mixed re- 
sults. 

[CHUNK 276]
Compared to caloric restriction, long term exercise is a more 
practical means of inducing BDNF and lifelong hormetic conditions. 


[CHUNK 277]
It is promising that clinical studies on long term exercise are 
becoming more prevalent; however, there remains a need for rig- 
orous, large scale exercise intervention trials for both normal cog- 
nitive aging and Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 278]
Most clinical trials have rela- 
tively small and homogenous sample populations and examine the 
effects of exercise over a limited time. 

[CHUNK 279]
Studies should aim to in- 
crease the size, diversity, and length of their exercise studies, as in 
studies of lifelong exercisers compared to sedentary older adults. 


[CHUNK 280]
It is also critical that clinical trials measure not only markers of 
cognition, but also markers of oxidative stress to further clarify 
their role in exercise-induced cognitive improvements. 

[CHUNK 281]
While much 
work remains, long term exercise has thus far been proven to re- 
duce oxidative stress, restore antioxidant activity, reduce patholog- 
ical markers, and increase the brain’s resilience to toxins. 

[CHUNK 282]
Of the 
currently available therapies, long term physical activity shows the 
greatest potential to reduce oxidative stress while promoting the 
homeostatic levels of stressors needed for optimal brain function.

Editorial on the Research Topic
Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
Late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease in which several risk
factors contribute to the onset and disease progression. 

[CHUNK 917]
Risk factors for AD include aging, sex,
lifestyle, comorbidities, and genetic factors. 

[CHUNK 918]
Considering the progressive aging of the population,
the prevention or delay of cognitive dysfunction by targeting modiﬁable risk factors is becoming
a therapeutic approach of growing interest. 

[CHUNK 919]
In this Research Topic, we have compiled a series of
manuscripts that describe emerging risk factors and the use of those for early diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 920]
In this
line, Edwards et al. 

[CHUNK 921]
clearly summarize the relationship between treatable comorbidities, lifestyle
habits and AD development. 

[CHUNK 922]
In this review, they expose data dealing with the preventive eﬀects
of moderate physical activity, a balanced diet and treatment of sleep disturbances. 

[CHUNK 923]
The eﬀect
of smoking and alcohol consumption to promote dementia is also debated as well as comorbid
medical conditions linked to this neurodegenerative disease such as cerebrovascular diseases or
depression. 

[CHUNK 924]
In this regard, Amtul et al. 

[CHUNK 925]
analyzed the eﬀect of cerebrovasculature alterations, such as
ischemia, and its causative link with the development of AD. 

[CHUNK 926]
It is remarkable the epidemiological
data on how stress, as a common cause of depression, has an important role on inducing
cognitive impairment, positing stress in the eye of the storm. 

[CHUNK 927]
In the same line, Ouanes and
Popp remark the relationship between high cortisol levels and increased risk of cognitive decline
and dementia. 

[CHUNK 928]
In fact, elevated cortisol not only aﬀects AD pathology but can also worsen sleep
and cardiovascular diseases. 

[CHUNK 929]
Modulation of glucocorticoids and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis functioning may be considered as a pharmacological target. 

[CHUNK 930]
Conversely, there is an
increasing number of reports indicating that long-term administration of benzodiazepines and
related hypnotic drugs to treat depression or insomnia may induce cognitive dysfunction as a side
eﬀect, especially in elderly population. 

[CHUNK 931]
Ettcheto et al. 

[CHUNK 932]
debate on the relevance of sleep disorders in
cognition and compile epidemiological clinical data, proposing that benzodiazepines may act as
contributing factors to prompt cognitive decline in aged AD patients rather than patients that may
be at higher risk are usually recommended to take them.


[CHUNK 933]
Although genetic variants are considered the primary cause for familial forms of AD, recent
evidences indicate that genetic variants are also a prominent risk factor for sporadic AD cases,
in addition to the apolipoprotein E (ApoE ε4 allele). 

[CHUNK 934]
Fernandez et al., Pietzuch et al., and Zhang
et al. 

[CHUNK 935]
highlight several causative mechanisms by which APOE4 mediates both amyloid beta
(Aβ) and tau pathology, altering brain connectivity and modulating the inﬂammatory process
and glucose. 

[CHUNK 936]
Furthermore, these toxic eﬀects triggered by ApoE are not only related to an
isoform-speciﬁc manner (mainly the ε4 allele), but new evidences also suggest that multiple
ApoE-related functions are speciﬁc to a particular cell type in the brain. 

[CHUNK 937]
In this regard, lipid
dysregulation, deﬁcient glucose metabolism and pro-inﬂammatory response in glia cells mediated
5


[CHUNK 938]
Moreno-Gonzalez et al.


[CHUNK 939]
Editorial: Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
by APOE are new exploratory means by which APOE
may contribute to the development of AD and more deep
understanding of these pathological processes could turn into
new promising therapeutic targets for AD. 

[CHUNK 940]
Zhang et al.


[CHUNK 941]
also emphasize other associated genes, such as the bridging
integrator 1(BIN1) and the sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1),
which modulate the amyloid and tau aggregates via alteration
endosomal traﬃcking.

triggering AD involves microbial infection (Moir et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 943]
Here, AD-associated Aβ would emerge after pathogen
neuroinvasion. 

[CHUNK 944]
These misfolded protein aggregates known to
have anti-microbial activity would act as a primary barrier of
defense, helping to clear pathogens from the brain (Soscia et al.,
2010). 

[CHUNK 945]
Complementary to this hypothesis, bacterial infection
also leads to peripheral inﬂammation and blood-brain barrier
(BBB) dysfunction. 

[CHUNK 946]
Interestingly, both events are known AD
risk factors and could act in conjunction or separately to
initiate the deleterious molecular pathways leading to AD. 

[CHUNK 947]
These
facts are nicely discussed by Giridharan et al.. Moreover, the
authors postulate that some outcomes derived from infection
(e.g., sepsis) may posit risks for dementia. 

[CHUNK 948]
Several lines of
investigation supporting this hypothesis are critically discussed
in this article. 

[CHUNK 949]
Following the role of peripheral tissue alterations
and AD, research on liver dysfunction as a potential risk factor
for dementia has been importantly neglected. 

[CHUNK 950]
Most of the Aβ
generated in the body is cleared by the liver (Hone et al., 2003)
and eliminated by the urine (Ghiso et al., 1997). 

[CHUNK 951]
In that sense, it is
surprising that little research has been done in this area. 

[CHUNK 952]
Estrada
et al. 

[CHUNK 953]
summarize direct and indirect evidence supporting the role
of liver damage speciﬁcally focused in non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease and related BBB dysfunction in the progression of AD.


[CHUNK 954]
Linked to the review by Giridharan et al. 

[CHUNK 955]
the authors also describe
the role of certain pathogens in liver health and their possible
involvement in AD by altering peripheral Aβ clearance.


[CHUNK 956]
At present, no pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests are available
for AD. 

[CHUNK 957]
In that sense, several non-invasive approaches linking
peripheral changes and dementia have been explored. 

[CHUNK 958]
Positive
associations have the potential beneﬁt to help in clinical trials
enrolment and implementation of preventive treatments in the
future. 

[CHUNK 959]
Nishizawa et al. 

[CHUNK 960]
describe that direct measurement of
abdominal visceral fat is inversely related to cognitive decline.


[CHUNK 961]
This result supports previous epidemiological data and has the
advantage of being directly performed by weighting the actual
adipose tissue at short post-mortem time windows. 

[CHUNK 962]
Similarly,
Liu et al. 

[CHUNK 963]
communicate that grip strength is linked to cognitive
function in a large Chinese cohort. 

[CHUNK 964]
Although attractive, it is
clear that confounding factors other than motor tests or physical
functions may be responsible for the observed outcomes.


[CHUNK 965]
In addition to the diﬀerent risk factors that have been
identiﬁed and that provide prospects to determine the potential
to develop AD, novel clinical approaches and biomarkers are
emerging in an eﬀort to monitor the onset and progression of AD
pathology and therefore, be used as early diagnostic assessments.


[CHUNK 966]
In this line, Qi et al. 

[CHUNK 967]
propose the evaluation of the functional
connectivity in the medial temporal lobe as a measurement of
initial memory impairment related with AD, providing a novel
imaging biomarker to predict and diagnose AD. 

[CHUNK 968]
On a similar
line, Amtul et al. 

[CHUNK 969]
provide with new evidences about the usefulness
of imaging microvascular alterations to determine the severity of
AD pathology. 

[CHUNK 970]
In a very compiling study, Sapkota et al. 

[CHUNK 971]
present
a variety of biomarkers for AD, including salivary biomarkers
in conjunction with other risk markers, and combine them in a
multi-modal array analysis to determine their collective ability to
discern and even predict the clinical status of AD patients and
mild cognitive impairment from cognitively normal individuals.


[CHUNK 972]
Overall, all these studies point out the necessity to identify
potential risk factors of AD, emphasizing the interrelation of
multiple of these factors and the utility of combining a variety
of markers to better predict and early diagnose AD. 

[CHUNK 973]
Although
modiﬁable risk may be somehow prevented or controlled, genetic
variations combined with other potential factors may hinder
AD prevention. 

[CHUNK 974]
Further understanding on the interrelationship
of these biomarkers will facilitate personalized therapeutic
interventions in individuals at risk.

Background: Among the neurodegenerative diseases of aging, sporadic Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is the most prevalent and perhaps the most feared. 

[CHUNK 1008]
With virtually
no success at ﬁnding pharmaceutical therapeutics for altering progressive AD after
diagnosis, research attention is increasingly directed at discovering biological and other
markers that detect AD risk in the long asymptomatic phase. 

[CHUNK 1009]
Both early detection and
precision preclinical intervention require systematic investigation of multiple modalities
and combinations of AD-related biomarkers and risk factors. 

[CHUNK 1010]
We extend recent unbiased
metabolomics research that produced a set of metabolite biomarker panels tailored
to the discrimination of cognitively normal (CN), cognitively impaired and AD patients.


[CHUNK 1011]
Speciﬁcally, we compare the prediction importance of these panels with ﬁve other sets
of modiﬁable and non-modiﬁable AD risk factors (genetic, lifestyle, cognitive, functional
health and bio-demographic) in three clinical groups.


[CHUNK 1012]
Method: The three groups were: CN (n = 35), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 25),
and AD (n = 22). 

[CHUNK 1013]
In a series of three pairwise comparisons, we used machine learning
technology random forest analysis (RFA) to test relative predictive importance of up to
19 risk biomarkers from the six AD risk domains.


[CHUNK 1014]
Results:
The
three
RFA
multimodal
prediction
analyses
produced
signiﬁcant
discriminating risk factors. 

[CHUNK 1015]
First, discriminating AD from CN was the AD metabolite
panel and two cognitive markers. 

[CHUNK 1016]
Second, discriminating AD from MCI was the AD/MCI
metabolite panel and two cognitive markers. 

[CHUNK 1017]
Third, discriminating MCI from CN was the
MCI metabolite panel and seven markers from four other risk modalities: genetic, lifestyle,
cognition and functional health.


[CHUNK 1018]
Conclusions: Salivary metabolomics biomarker panels, supplemented by other risk
markers, were robust predictors of: (1) clinical differences in impairment and dementia

INTRODUCTION
Epidemiological projections point in the direction of increased
worldwide prevalence and growing burden of neurodegenerative
disease, especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD; Prince et al., 2015;
Alzheimer’s Association, 2016; Wimo et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1024]
Given the
lack of success in developing therapeutics to reverse the course
of neurodegeneration in aging after diagnosis (Cummings et al.,
2014), research and clinical attention has shifted to multimodal
risk detection in asymptomatic phases (Sperling et al., 2011) so as
to promote early risk management or prevention (Anstey et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 1025]
Early detection of sporadic AD may require systematic
attention to multiple modalities of biomarkers and risk factors,
perhaps beyond (but including) the established neurobiological
and clinical hallmarks of the disease (e.g., beta amyloid; Barnes
and Yaffe, 2011). 

[CHUNK 1026]
Accordingly, recent research has focused on
testing panels, dosages, and interactions of multiple biomarkers,
examining their synergistic, modifying, or complementary
influences on phenotypes, pre-clinical trajectories or clinical
status (Edwards et al., 2015; McFall et al., 2015a; Iturria-
Medina et al., 2016; Sapkota et al., 2017; Sapkota and
Dixon, 2018). 

[CHUNK 1027]
Arguably, identifying perturbations in profiles of
biomarkers in asymptomatic periods of impairment or AD may
provide a promising opportunity for developing precision or
programmatic interventions that could delay or prevent clinical
diagnosis (Imtiaz et al., 2014; Hampel et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1028]
However,
translational progress may be optimized when one or more
of three conditions are available: (1) a roster of established
multi-modal modifiable risk biomarkers are included; (2) these
risk biomarkers can be estimated with valid but relatively
non-invasive technology; and (3) comparative prediction and
discrimination data are available (Anstey et al., 2015; Olanrewaju
et al., 2015; Casanova et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 1029]
We
adopt
a
multi-modal
comparative
approach
to
determining the relative importance of multiple established
risk biomarkers of cognitive impairment and AD. 

[CHUNK 1030]
The six
AD risk biomarker clusters include: (1) novel metabolomics
biomarker panels; (2) selected AD genetic risk polymorphisms
(e.g.,
Apolipoprotein
E
(APOE));
(3)
functional
health
(e.g.,
vascular);
(4)
lifestyle
engagement
(e.g.,
physical
activity);
(5)
cognitive
performance
(e.g.,
memory);
and
(6) bio-demographic factors (e.g., sex). 

[CHUNK 1031]
A total of 19 risk
biomarkers are available for testing simultaneously in three
pairwise competitive analyses conducted with machine learning
technology random forest analyses (RFA). 

[CHUNK 1032]
This approach
identifies the predictors that contribute most significantly to
the discrimination of the clinical groups. 

[CHUNK 1033]
In the present study,
these groups include the benchmark cognitively normal (CN)
as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD groups.


[CHUNK 1034]
The predictors vary in the extent to which they are likely
to be modifiable, an important consideration for potential
downstream intervention (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011; Anstey
et al., 2013b, 2015; Norton et al., 2014; Livingston et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 1035]
We limited our predictors to those that are likely to require
relatively non-invasive assessment techniques. 

[CHUNK 1036]
Accordingly,
in the present study, both metabolomics and genetic markers
were developed from salivary samples. 

[CHUNK 1037]
A central aim of this
study was to examine the extent to which newly discovered
metabolomics biomarker panels would emerge as important
predictors of MCI and AD in the competitive context of a broad
range of other established and relatively non-invasive AD risk
factors.


[CHUNK 1038]
Two of the present biomarker clusters are derived from
salivary samples collected in the context of longitudinal study
of aging. 

[CHUNK 1039]
Saliva is of interest in research on biomarkers of
neurodegenerative diseases and aging for several reasons. 

[CHUNK 1040]
It
is a premier non-invasive biofluid, easily collected and stored
(Wong, 2006) and increasingly acknowledged for its potential
as a source fluid for genomic, metabolomics and candidate
biomarker studies (Wishart et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 1041]
Its
viability for DNA extraction and genotyping is well established
and effectively applied in genetics of aging and dementia (McFall
et al., 2016; Sapkota et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1042]
Recently, metabolomics
technology has advanced such that salivary samples have
provided source fluids for biomarker discovery in AD (Liang
et al., 2015; Figueira et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 1043]
In our previous work, we have
used salivary samples for genotyping, biomarker network and
interaction analyses (McFall et al., 2016; Sapkota et al., 2017),
and metabolomics-based discovery of biomarkers of impairment
and AD (Zheng et al., 2012; Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1044]
Although not yet
comprehensively compared across biofluid modalities, salivary
biomarkers may enable better accessibility to a wider range of
worldwide and diversity samples than as yet available via more
traditional biofluids (blood, cerebral spinal fluid; Hu et al., 2010;
Thambisetty and Lovestone, 2010; Mousavi et al., 2014; Trushina
and Mielke, 2014; Liang et al., 2016; Simpson et al., 2016; Toledo
et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 1045]
The first set of biomarkers was developed in a previous
salivary metabolomics analysis of CN, MCI and AD samples.


[CHUNK 1046]
Metabolomics is a global approach to detecting perturbations
in metabolic pathways that can reflect early and subtle disease-
related changes in the central nervous system (Kaddurah-
Daouk
and
Krishnan,
2009).

[CHUNK 1051]
The result of a
metabolomics analysis is an empirically and quantitatively
derived set of metabolites that discriminate between two
clinical groups and provide targets for further analyses of
mechanisms, associations and clinical applications (Mishur
and Rea, 2012; Ibáñez et al., 2013; Enche Ady et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 1052]
In the present study, we assemble a set of discovered and
verified discriminant metabolite panels (comprised of more
than one biomarker) from a recent salivary AD metabolomics
study (Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1053]
Specifically, we developed putatively
identified metabolite panels discriminating CN, MCI and AD
groups (Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1054]
Unique metabolite biomarker panels
were developed for each pairwise comparison and all panels
displayed very high sensitivity for the comparisons. 

[CHUNK 1055]
The AD
biomarker panel (discriminating AD from CN) was comprised of
three metabolites (Methylguanosine, Histidinyl-Phenylalanine,
Choline-cytidine) that were associated with the phenylalanine
and histamine biosynthesis pathways (Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1056]
The
AD/MCI panel was comprised of three metabolites (Amino-
dihydroxybenzene, Glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine −H2O,
Aminobutyric acid + H2) that were provisionally associated with
lipid metabolism pathways1. 

[CHUNK 1057]
The MCI/CN panel was comprised
of two metabolites (Glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine −H2O,
Glutamine-carnitine) and provisionally associated with carnitine
synthesis, oxidation of branched chain fatty acid, lipid and
fatty acid metabolism pathways2. 

[CHUNK 1058]
Details of the metabolomics
procedures used in the earlier study are available elsewhere
(Zheng et al., 2012; Huan et al., 2018) and are summarized in
the present ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ section.


[CHUNK 1059]
The genetic biomarker modality was also derived from
salivary samples. 

[CHUNK 1060]
We selected AD genetic risk markers from an
available pool with relatively known properties and application
in multi-modal biomarker research (Williams et al., 2010; Karch
et al., 2014; Karch and Goate, 2015; Huynh and Mohan, 2017).


[CHUNK 1061]
All four were detected in genome-wide association studies
and frequently linked to AD and cognitive decline (Harold
et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2009; Chibnik et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 1062]
The
four genetic markers are: APOE rs7412, (rs429358; Brainerd
et al., 2011; Dixon et al., 2014; Runge et al., 2014; Mahoney-
Sanchez et al., 2016), Complement receptor 1 (CR1; rs6656401;
Crehan et al., 2012; Fonseca et al., 2016), Clusterin (CLU;
rs11136000; Thambisetty et al., 2013; McFall et al., 2016) and
Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM;
rs3851179; Barral et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2012; Ferencz et al.,
2014; Morgen et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 1063]
APOE is the most established genetic
risk factor for AD and is involved in lipid transport and
metabolism (Liu et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 1064]
CR1 may be involved in rate of
Aβ42 clearance in AD (Lambert et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 1065]
CLU has been
associated with regulation of lipid transport, Aβ clearance, and
brain atrophy (Karch and Goate, 2015). 

[CHUNK 1066]
PICALM is involved in
Aβ peptide production and connected to Aβ metabolism and
plaque formation (Xiao et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 1067]

2http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB0000062
The remaining sets of AD risk factors have been examined
in observational research, reported in reviews, and linked to
early AD detection and potential prevention (Livingston et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 1068]
The functional health predictor domain included three
dementia-related biomarkers: pulse pressure (PP), body mass
index (BMI) and gait timed walk; Qiu et al., 2003; Dahl et al.,
2013; Mielke et al., 2013; Emmerzaal et al., 2015; McDade
et al., 2016; McFall et al., 2016; MacDonald et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1069]
PP, a
reliable proxy of arterial stiffness has been considered a better
predictor of poor vascular health compared to systolic blood
pressure alone (Raz et al., 2011; Nation et al., 2013) and linked
to (1) AD biomarkers in CN and AD risk (Nation et al.,
2013; McFall et al., 2016); (2) MCI (Yaneva-Sirakova et al.,
2012); (3) cerebral small vessel disease (Singer et al., 2014); and
(4) cognitive decline (McFall et al., 2015b). 

[CHUNK 1070]
Lower late-life BMI
and higher mid-life BMI has consistently been linked to increased
dementia risk (Emmerzaal et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 1071]
Potential mechanisms
(Emmerzaal et al., 2015) include: (1) greater inflammation
(Yaffe et al., 2004); (2) structural brain changes (Pannacciulli
et al., 2006); and (3) higher cholesterol levels in mid-life and
lower levels in late-life (Mielke et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 1072]
The lifestyle
activity predictor domain included four markers of everyday
engagement, with higher levels often associated with AD risk
reduction and lower levels with risk elevation. 

[CHUNK 1073]
A standard
self-report instrument represented levels of everyday integrative
cognitive, novel cognitive, physical and social activities (Deary
et al., 2006; Bherer et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Vemuri
et al., 2014; Thibeau et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1074]
Cognitively stimulating lifestyle
activities (Vemuri et al., 2012) and physical activities (Chen
et al., 2016; Falck et al., 2017) have been shown to delay AD
onset. 

[CHUNK 1075]
Specifically, physical activities may lead to improvements
in neurogenesis as a result of increased cerebral blood flow in
the dentate gyrus (Chen et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 1076]
The cognitive performance
predictor domain included four measures: episodic memory
(as early cognitive manifestation associated with hippocampal
dysfunction), EF (Stroop, which tests the ability to inhibit
cognitive interferences; Scarpina and Tagini, 2017), speed
(simple reaction time, the level of which reflects slower or
faster processing speed potential indicator of early normal or
preclinical cognitive decline (McFall et al., 2015a), and global
cognition (assessed with the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)).


[CHUNK 1077]
The bio-demographic domain included age, sex and education
(Li and Singh, 2014; Schneeweis et al., 2014; Jack et al., 2015;
Cadar et al., 2016; Riedel et al., 2016; Sachdev et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 1078]
Age
is the most important non-modifiable risk factor for developing
AD with large number of sporadic AD cases occurring after
65 years (Guerreiro and Bras, 2015). 

[CHUNK 1079]
Sex differences have been
observed in AD with significantly higher prevalence in women
than men (Mazure and Swendsen, 2016). 

[CHUNK 1080]
Lifestyle experiences
and choices (i.e., diet, exercise) vary by sex and may have an
indirect influence on the brain over the lifespan (Mazure and
Swendsen, 2016). 

[CHUNK 1081]
Education has widely been used as a proxy
for cognitive reserve (Tucker and Stern, 2011; Stern, 2012,
2017). 

[CHUNK 1082]
Adults with higher cognitive reserve (higher education
levels) may have greater tolerance to AD pathology than those
with lower cognitive reserve (lower education levels; Stern,
2012).

Multi-Modal Biomarkers and Alzheimer’s Disease
For each of three comparative RFA prediction models we
included up to 19 predictors. 

[CHUNK 1086]
RFA is a machine-learning-based
data exploration technique that combines large numbers of
regression tree predictions from a random sample of participants
and variables (Strobl et al., 2009; McDermott et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1087]
It
accommodates multiple predictors and smaller sample sizes,
producing a solution that features a rank ordering of the top
important predictors of the target clinical condition. 

[CHUNK 1088]
The general
objective was to examine and compare the extent to which new
salivary metabolite biomarker panels fared in the competitive
context of other AD biomarkers in predicting clinical status in
pairwise comparisons across three groups: CN, MCI and AD.


[CHUNK 1089]
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were community-dwelling older adult volunteers
from the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS), an ongoing
multi-cohort investigation of biomedical, genetic, metabolic,
functional,
neurocognitive
and
other
aspects
of
aging,
impairment and dementia. 

[CHUNK 1090]
This study was carried out in
accordance with the recommendations of the Human Research
Ethics Guidelines, University of Alberta with written informed
consent from all subjects. 

[CHUNK 1091]
All subjects gave written informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 

[CHUNK 1092]
The
protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics Board.


[CHUNK 1093]
Detailed information on overall VLS recruitment, research
design, and participant characteristics are available elsewhere
(Dixon and de Frias, 2004; McFall et al., 2015a). 

[CHUNK 1094]
For the present
study, the CN and MCI participants were drawn from a subset
of the main cohorts that participated in the VLS biofluid
and genetics initiative (2009–2012). 

[CHUNK 1095]
The AD patients were
recruited from the Geriatric and Cognitive Clinic at the Glenrose
Rehabilitation Hospital (Edmonton). 

[CHUNK 1096]
All participants (N = 82)
received a small honorarium for their contributions. 

[CHUNK 1097]
The present
research includes adults classified as CN (n = 35; age 64–75 years;
62.9% female), MCI (n = 25; age 64–75 years; 60% female), and
diagnosed AD (n = 22; age 52–91; 72.7% female). 

[CHUNK 1098]
Participant
demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1.


[CHUNK 1099]
Classiﬁcation and Diagnosis
To select CN and MCI participants, we initially applied
exclusionary criteria (no diagnosed dementia, cardiovascular
disease, stroke history, or psychiatric illness, MMSE ≥24) and
inclusionary criteria (two waves (4.5 years) of longitudinal data,

complete data on a separate cognitive reference battery). 

[CHUNK 1104]
We
implemented an established and objective four-step cognitive
classification procedure that requires strict adherence to specific
assessment and selection rules (Dixon et al., 2007, 2014; de
Frias et al., 2009; Dolcos et al., 2012; Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1105]
We
conducted the full classification procedure at each of two waves
(about 4.5 years apart). 

[CHUNK 1106]
At both waves, eligible participants
completed a five-domain cognitive battery, including measures
of key domains: perceptual speed, inductive reasoning, episodic
memory, verbal fluency and semantic memory. 

[CHUNK 1107]
The procedure
was as follows. 

[CHUNK 1108]
Source participants were: (1) stratified into
two age (64–73 and 74–95) and education (0–12 years and
13 + years) groups; (2) placed in appropriate age x education
subgroups; (3) analyzed for mean cognitive scores on all
tests; and (4) evaluated by score within respective age x
education subgroups. 

[CHUNK 1109]
We applied a moderate criterion to
establish higher or lower (‘‘impaired’’) group based on one
standard deviation below the subgroup mean for any cognitive
test. 

[CHUNK 1110]
For participants to be classified as CN or MCI they
were required to be objectively stable in their classification
at both waves (at least 4.5 years). 

[CHUNK 1111]
The procedure resulted in
n = 25 MCI participants, who we then matched (age, sex) with
CN adults and supplemented with randomly selected additional
participants (n = 35). 

[CHUNK 1112]
Overall, this approach emphasizes objective
and stable classification, reducing the risk of false assignments
and enhancing homogeneity of the groups (Dolcos et al.,
2012; Bondi et al., 2014; Dixon et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 1113]
AD patients
were recruited from the Geriatric and Cognitive Neurology
clinics at the Glenrose Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. 

[CHUNK 1114]
The
clinical diagnosis of AD was based on the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition) criteria
for Dementia of the Alzheimer Type. 

[CHUNK 1115]
Clinical assessments were
performed as part of routine clinical evaluation, which included
caregiver report of cognitive decline and impaired functional
status, mental status evaluation of the patient (including the
MMSE and Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and a physical and
neurological examination. 

[CHUNK 1116]
All patients had routine laboratory
assessment for causes of dementia, including blood work and
brain imaging according to Canadian Consensus Guidelines
(Gauthier et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 1117]
Imaging excluded significant vascular
pathology; however, cerebrospinal or other amyloid biomarkers
were not available. 

[CHUNK 1118]
AD patients did not have vascular dementia
based on a modified ischemic score >4. 

[CHUNK 1119]
Medical comorbidity
was recorded using the modified Cumulative Illness Rating
Scale.


[CHUNK 1120]
Salivary Samples
Salivary samples were collected and prepared according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. 

[CHUNK 1121]
Participants were instructed not to
eat one hour before testing and light washing was permitted
prior to saliva collection. 

[CHUNK 1122]
One saliva sample was collected
per participant. 

[CHUNK 1123]
The time of day for saliva collection varied
throughout across participants. 

[CHUNK 1124]
At a regular point in the data
collection for each participant, the saliva collection task was
announced, instructions were delivered, and the device was
displayed and described. 

[CHUNK 1125]
As the overall procedure was not
time-limited, there was sufficient time for full samples from

all individuals. 

[CHUNK 1128]
We used the Oragene® • DNA Self-Collection
Kit OG-500 (DNA Genotek Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada). 

[CHUNK 1129]
Whole
saliva was collected, placed inside the kit, and shaken. 

[CHUNK 1130]
The kit
contained an Oragene DNA-preserving solution. 

[CHUNK 1131]
The ingredients
of Oragene solution include ethyl alcohol (>24%) and Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 8). 

[CHUNK 1132]
As provided by established procedures, samples
stored at room temperature were analyzed for DNA extraction,
genotyping and the metabolomics analyses. 

[CHUNK 1133]
Our previous pilot
study included an analysis of five different saliva samples
from CN adults collected at varying times of the day and
stored at different temperatures to examine performance of the
metabolomics profiling method. 

[CHUNK 1134]
We observed that metabolites
detected for each individual sample significantly discriminated
the individuals despite small metabolite variations that may have
been present for samples collected at different times of the day.


[CHUNK 1135]
In addition, there were relatively minor metabolite variations
across a range of storage temperatures (room temperature,
−20◦C, −80◦C; Zheng et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 1136]
All saliva samples were
then preserved in −80◦C for long-term storage and follow-up
studies.

Alzheimer’s Predictors From Six Risk
Domains
In this section, we describe the procedures for obtaining the
risk and biomarker data. 

[CHUNK 1138]
These included two AD biomarker
clusters using salivary samples: (1) salivary metabolites; and
(2) genetic polymorphisms. 

[CHUNK 1139]
The remaining domains were:
(3) functional health; (4) lifestyle activity; (5) cognition; and
(6) bio-demographic. 

[CHUNK 1140]
We recruited diagnosed AD patients with
mild form of dementia and limited available time for the
testing session than the other two groups. 

[CHUNK 1141]
Thus, we reduced
the cognitive and physical load of our testing sessions for them.


[CHUNK 1142]
The total number of predictors differed between the clinical
status discrimination analyses because the AD group was not
tested on PP, BMI and lifestyle activities.


[CHUNK 1143]
Metabolomics Procedure and Metabolite Panel
Development
The metabolomics analyses leading to the present biomarker
panels were performed in a previous study (Huan et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 1144]
In the study establishing the present biomarker panels, we
applied a salivary metabolomics workflow with a differential
chemical isotope labeling based liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) platform using dansylation derivatization
for an in-depth profiling of the amine/phenol submetabolome
(Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1145]
This was adapted and extended from earlier
pilot work on saliva metabolome profiling (Zheng et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 1146]
Five microliters saliva sample was aliquoted out from each
individual sample and labeled with 12C-DnsCl. 

[CHUNK 1147]
A pooled sample
was prepared by mixing small aliquots of individual samples and
then labeled with 13C-DnsCl. 

[CHUNK 1148]
The 12C-labeled individual sample
was then mixed with 13C-labeled pooled sample in a 1:1 amount
ratio after the total concentration of the labeled metabolites was
determined by LC-ultraviolet. 

[CHUNK 1149]
The 12C-/13C- ion pairs belonging
to the labeled amine/phenol submetabolome were extracted from
raw LC-MS data by a peak pair picking program, IsoMS (Zhou
et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 1150]
Missing values in the ion pair list was retrieved using
Zero-fill (Huan and Li, 2015a) by searching and filling in the
missing values from the raw MS data. 

[CHUNK 1151]
Accurate intensity ratios
of the ion pairs were reconstructed by their chromatographic
peak ratios using IsoMS-Quant (Huan and Li, 2015b). 

[CHUNK 1152]
After the
LC-MS data processing, multivariate statistical analysis of the
LC-MS data was conducted using SIMCA-P + 12.0 (Umetrics,
Umeå, Sweden).


[CHUNK 1153]
The metabolite biomarker panels were determined as follows
(Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1154]
Pairwise statistical comparisons used
orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-
DA) and volcano plot analyses. 

[CHUNK 1155]
The diagnostic power of the
common metabolites that were highly ranked with both statistical
tools was then evaluated by receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis and linear SVM model using MetaboAnalyst (Xia
et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 1156]
For positive or definitive metabolite identification,
the peak pairs were matched against a Dns-standards library
(Huan et al., 2015) by retention time and accurate mass. 

[CHUNK 1157]
In
addition, putative metabolite identification was performed based
on accurate mass match of the peak pairs found to the metabolites
in the Human Metabolome Database (Wishart et al., 2013) and
the Evidence-based Metabolome Library using MyCompoundID
(Li et al., 2013), with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm.


[CHUNK 1158]
As a final step in the discovery phase, a machine learning
linear SVM tool in MetaboAnalyst (Xia et al., 2012) was
used to develop a diagnostic model for each of the three
pairwise comparisons with: (1) 63 metabolites discriminating
AD vs. 

[CHUNK 1159]
CN; (2) 47 metabolites discriminating AD vs. 

[CHUNK 1160]
MCI;
and (3) two metabolites discriminating MCI vs. 

[CHUNK 1161]
CN. 

[CHUNK 1162]
In a
follow-up validation phase, the diagnostic performance was
further evaluated in a small (n = 27) but independent data
set drawn from the same population. 

[CHUNK 1163]
Specifically, validation
was tested with similarly classified or diagnosed CN (age
68–75 years, 50% female), MCI; age 67–75 years, 50% female),
and AD; age 53–91 years, 71.4% female) groups (Huan et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 1164]
The final diagnostic model best discriminated: (a) AD
from CN with the AD metabolite panel (Methylguanosine,
Histidinyl-Phenylalanine,
Choline-cytidine);
(b)
AD
from
MCI with the AD/MCI metabolite (Amino-dihydroxybenzene,
Glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine −H2O, Aminobutyric acid
+ H2); and (c) MCI from CN with the MCI metabolite panel
(Glucosylgalactosyl hydroxylysine −H2O, Glutamine-carinitine;
Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1165]
The additive score is comprised of the sum
of all the values for each metabolite in the three diagnostic
models and was used as the final metabolite panel in the present
clinical status prediction analyses. 

[CHUNK 1166]
Higher score indicated higher
metabolite concentration in the diseased group.


[CHUNK 1167]
Genetic Markers
DNA was manually extracted from 0.8 ml of saliva sample
mix using the manufacturer’s protocol with adjusted reagent
volumes. 

[CHUNK 1168]
Genotyping was carried out by using a PCR-RFLP
strategy to analyze the allele status for APOE (rs7412, rs429358),
CR1 (rs6656401), CLU (rs11136000) and PICALM (rs3851179).


[CHUNK 1169]
Genotyping was successful for the targeted SNPs for all present
participants (McFall et al., 2015a). 

[CHUNK 1170]
We included all three allelic
combinations coded from 1 (lowest risk) to 3 (highest risk) for
CR1 (G/G = 1, G/A = 2, A/A = 3), CLU (T/T = 1, T/C = 2,

[CHUNK 1173]
For
APOE, the study sample did not include any ε2/ε4 carriers and,
therefore, the remaining five allelic combinations were coded
from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk; ε2/ε2 = 1, ε2/ε3 = 2,
ε3/ε3 = 3, ε3/ε4 = 4, ε4/ε4 = 5).


[CHUNK 1174]
Functional Health
In this category we included PP, BMI and gait (timed walk)
as predictors. 

[CHUNK 1175]
PP was calculated with systolic minus diastolic
blood pressure (McFall et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 1176]
BMI was obtained from
measurements of weight in kilograms and height in centimeters.


[CHUNK 1177]
BMI was calculated by taking the weight in kilograms divided by
the square of one’s height in meters (kg/m2; MacDonald et al.,
2011; Besser et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 1178]
A timed walking test was used to
measure gait speed for all participants. 

[CHUNK 1179]
The CN and MCI groups
began the walking task from a standing position, a standard
procedure for individuals with no mobility or dementia concerns.


[CHUNK 1180]
Specifically, the CN and MCI groups were measured by asking
participants to walk a distance of 3 m, turn around, and walk
back (MacDonald et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1181]
AD patients began the task from a
sitting position in an arm chair (i.e., the Timed Up and Go Test,
a standard task in dementia research). 

[CHUNK 1182]
Participants were seated in
an armchair, and asked to get up and walk 3 m, turn around, walk
and sit back in the chair. 

[CHUNK 1183]
The time taken to complete this task was
measured with a stopwatch in seconds. 

[CHUNK 1184]
PP, BMI and timed walk
were included as continuous variables.


[CHUNK 1185]
Lifestyle Activity
The commonly used VLS Activity Lifestyle Questionnaire has
67 items measuring seven types of lifestyle engagement (Hultsch
et al., 1999; Dolcos et al., 2012; Small et al., 2012) From the
full inventory, we extracted items (n = 50) associated with
the key dementia-related lifestyle aspects (cognitive, physical,
and social). 

[CHUNK 1186]
We evaluated two types of cognitive activities:
(1) integrative information processing measured (n = 12) such
as playing a musical instrument or household repairs, and
(2) novel information processing (n = 27) such as completing
jigsaw puzzles or reading the newspaper (Runge et al., 2014;
Sapkota et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1187]
Physical activity (n = 4) included jogging
or gardening (Thibeau et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 1188]
Social activity (n = 7)
included volunteering or visiting friends (Brown et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 1189]
The
frequency of participation is rated on a 9-point scale with never
(0), less than once a year (1), about once a year (2), 2 or 3 times
a year (3), about once a month (4), 2 or 3 times a month (5),
about once a week (6), 2 or 3 times a week (7), and daily (8).


[CHUNK 1190]
All the items were summed for each domain with higher scores
representing greater frequency of activity (e.g., Small et al., 2012;
Runge et al., 2014; Sapkota et al., 2017; Thibeau et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 1191]
Cognition
The cognitive performance domain was represented by four
standardized tests covering key aspects of performance known
to be associated with differential normal and impaired aging,
as well as dementia. 

[CHUNK 1192]
First, to represent memory we used the
standard VLS Word Recall task (Dixon and de Frias, 2004).


[CHUNK 1193]
From a pool of six equivalent lists, two different but comparable
lists of 30 English words (i.e., six taxonomic categories with
five words each) were used. 

[CHUNK 1194]
Participants were given 2 min to
study the list and 5 min to write down their answers. 

[CHUNK 1195]
The
total numbers of words correctly recalled from each list was
averaged and used as the final score (Josefsson et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 1196]
Second, to measure EF (inhibition) we used the Stroop test
(Scarpina and Tagini, 2017). 

[CHUNK 1197]
This test consists of the standard
three parts (Parts A, B and C), with the measures based on
latencies. 

[CHUNK 1198]
The score is the standardized Stroop interference index
([Part C−Part A]/ Part A), with a lower index reflecting better
performance (MacLeod, 1991; de Frias et al., 2009; Diamond,
2013). 

[CHUNK 1199]
Third, to measure speed we used the SRT task (Dixon
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 1200]
In this computer-based nonverbal response time
task participants press a key on the response console with the
index finger of their dominant hand at every occurrence of the
target stimulus as quickly as possible. 

[CHUNK 1201]
Response latencies were
recorded to a precision of ±1 ms as the final score (McFall
et al., 2015a). 

[CHUNK 1202]
Fourth, for global cognition, we used examined the
MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975), which measures performance on a
scale of 0–30.


[CHUNK 1203]
Bio-Demographic
The VLS personal data inventory was used to determine type and
level of demographic risk (Anstey et al., 2013a; Sachdev et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 1204]
We examined education (total number of school years;
Amieva et al., 2014; Cadar et al., 2016), age (in years; Small et al.,
2011; Papenberg et al., 2015), and sex (male vs. 

[CHUNK 1205]
female; Altmann
et al., 2014; Li and Singh, 2014; McDermott et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 1206]
Statistical Analyses
RFA
is
a
machine
learning
technology
that
applies
a
nonparametric approach to assess a large number of predictors
in both complex and small data sets (Strobl et al., 2009; Kuhn
and Johnson, 2013). 

[CHUNK 1207]
These applications include biomarker
predictions related to AD (Kaup et al., 2015; McDermott et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 1208]
We used RFA from the Party package (Hothorn et al.,
2005) in RStudio version 1.0.136 (2017). 

[CHUNK 1209]
The analysis combines
regression trees based on a random selection of participants
and variables. 

[CHUNK 1210]
The regression trees are all combined and
then used to rank variables according to their importance in
predicting an outcome. 

[CHUNK 1211]
The RFA party package accounts for
any potential correlated predictor variables (Strobl et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 1212]
Any missing values were imputed using the missForest package
(Stekhoven and Bühlmann, 2012). 

[CHUNK 1213]
All the forests in our analyses
examined 5,000 trees and a random sample of 10 predictors
was tested at each potential split. 

[CHUNK 1214]
The analyses ranked relative
predictive importance based on standard statistical operations
and procedural recommendations (Strobl et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 1215]
The
metric for these rankings is termed ‘‘variable importance,’’ which
specifies how important each factor is in discriminating two
groups relative to all other factors in the model. 

[CHUNK 1216]
Goodness of
model fit for each RFA analyses was examined with area under
the ROC curve (C-statistics). 

[CHUNK 1217]
The C-statistic ranges from 0.50 to
1.00 can be interpreted as equivalent to the Area under the Curve
in a ROC analysis where higher values are associated with better
predictive models. 

[CHUNK 1218]
Any variables with negative, zero, or small
positive values are determined as not important predictors; these
are represented to the left of the vertical dashed line.

CN). 

[CHUNK 1233]
First, we tested which of the 13 risk factors
were the most important predictors for discriminating clinical
status for: (1) AD vs. 

[CHUNK 1234]
CN and (2) AD vs. 

[CHUNK 1235]
MCI. 

[CHUNK 1236]
Second, we tested
which of the 19 risk factors were the most important predictors

[CHUNK 1238]
RESULTS
Across the three multi-modal prediction analyses, we observed
significant discrimination for the pairwise comparisons of
the three clinical groups with predictors from the six AD
biomarker risk domains (see Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 1239]
First, for the AD vs.


[CHUNK 1240]
CN analysis, three important discriminative predictors were
identified (C-statistic: 1.00). 

[CHUNK 1241]
As shown in Figure 1A, the top
predictors included two cognitive measures (speed and memory)
and the AD metabolite panel. 

[CHUNK 1242]
Specifically: (1) poorer memory
performance; (2) slower speed performance; and (3) higher
levels (greater risk) of the AD metabolite panel discriminated
AD from CN group at a high level of importance. 

[CHUNK 1243]
Second, for
the AD vs. 

[CHUNK 1244]
MCI analysis the same two cognitive predictors
and the AD/MCI metabolite panel were identified as important
predictors (C-statistic: 0.99). 

[CHUNK 1245]
As can be seen in Figure 1B, A
different order of importance was observed: (1) slower speed
performance; (2) poorer memory performance; and (3) higher
levels (greater risk) of the AD/MCI metabolite panel were
the most important factors discriminating the AD and MCI
groups. 

[CHUNK 1246]
Third, as shown in Figure 1C, in the MCI vs.


[CHUNK 1247]
CN analysis, seven of the 19 predictors were identified as
important in discriminating the groups (C-statistic = 0.94).


[CHUNK 1248]
Notably, the seven predictors represented five (of the six)
risk domains (see Figure 1C). 

[CHUNK 1249]
Specifically, the most important
predictors for discriminating MCI from CN were: (1) higher PP;
(2) higher levels of the MCI metabolite panel; (3) poorer memory
performance; (4) lower frequency of novel cognitive activity;
(5) elevated APOE risk; (6) decreased social activity; and (7) lower
MMSE score.

DISCUSSION
We
examined
and
compared
neurodegenerative
disease
status predictions by selected modifiable and non-modifiable
AD risk factors representing six prominent modalities. 

[CHUNK 1251]
The
relative prediction patterns were examined for the pairwise
discrimination of the three groups (CN, MCI and AD). 

[CHUNK 1252]
An
important aim was to test the extent to which recently discovered
salivary metabolomics biomarker panels (Huan et al., 2018)
would perform in the competitive context of other biomarkers
and risk factors of AD. 

[CHUNK 1253]
Given the dynamic, insidious and
multi-factorial nature of AD, it is likely that multiple modalities
of risk biomarkers may contribute to the diagnosis of the disease.


[CHUNK 1254]
A corresponding emerging interest is in determining viable
combinations of predictors for use in timely (early) detection
and targeted (precise) intervention. 

[CHUNK 1255]
Our results supported
both the multi-modal predictor expectation and the potential
valuable role that salivary-based biomarkers discovered through
metabolomics analyses may play in identifying important
components of AD biomarker batteries.


[CHUNK 1256]
In our earlier metabolomics analyses, we detected salivary
metabolite panels that were most accurate in discriminating the
three groups (Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1257]
In this study, we examined
how these panels performed in discriminating these groups
in the competitive context of other known AD biomarkers
or risk factors. 

[CHUNK 1258]
In each of the three pairwise comparisons,
the RFA results showed that the relevant metabolite panel
was among the top important predictors. 

[CHUNK 1259]

and AD/MCI metabolite panels and the same two cognitive

[CHUNK 1268]
Sapkota et al.


[CHUNK 1269]
Multi-Modal Biomarkers and Alzheimer’s Disease
performance measures—i.e., speed and memory—in a different
order discriminated AD from CN and AD from MCI. 

[CHUNK 1270]
For the
AD-CN comparison, the important predictors were memory,
followed by speed and the AD metabolite panel. 

[CHUNK 1271]
The AD
metabolite panel represents pathways involved in AD protein
regulation (Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1272]
For the AD-MCI comparison,
speed and memory were among the most important predictors,
and the associated AD/MCI metabolite panel also contributed
at an important level. 

[CHUNK 1273]
Dipeptides identified in both the AD
metabolite panel and AD/MCI metabolite panel may reinforce
the role of protein dysregulation in AD as a result of degraded
proteins from amyloid or tau (Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1274]
Memory
decline and impairment is a cardinal marker of preclinical
dementia and is described as an oft-reported clinical symptom of
aging and impairment (McKhann et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 1275]
Poorer memory
performance in AD is consistent with key memory-related
structural changes observed in the aging and impaired brain
(Bartsch and Wulff, 2015). 

[CHUNK 1276]
Specifically, hippocampal atrophy
rates are comparatively greater in MCI than CN older adults
and whole brain atrophy rates are greater in AD patients than
MCI (Henneman et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 1277]
Slower speed performance has
shown to be an early marker of lower and steeper cognitive
decline (McFall et al., 2015a) and may be associated with
poorer executive functioning and memory performance as well
as increased dementia risk (Bäckman et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 1278]
Slower speed
performance is also positively correlated with white matter tracts
especially in the parietal and temporal cortices, and the left
middle frontal gyrus (Turken et al., 2008).


[CHUNK 1279]
Much attention in recent years has been on the detection of
early signs—and their biomarker predictors—of transitions from
CN to mildly impaired aging (Albert et al., 2011; Brainerd et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 1280]
Recently, this transition has also been investigated with
unbiased metabolomics procedures (Zheng et al., 2012; Figueira
et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2016; Huan et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 1281]
Two related
challenges are that: (1) neither group is diagnosable with AD and
(2) the exact probabilities of individual future conversion to AD
are unknown. 

[CHUNK 1282]
Moreover, both groups are likely to be in fluctuant,
even overlapping, states of brain and cognitive aging—as
indicated by the phenomenon of reversion (Manly et al., 2008;
Koepsell and Monsell, 2012). 

[CHUNK 1283]
Reviews of this challenge have led to
the recommendation that multiple biomarkers and longitudinal
data are advisable for differential classification. 

[CHUNK 1284]
In the present
study, these two groups were exactingly and objectively classified
based on longitudinal data. 

[CHUNK 1285]
Specifically, both groups were
comprised of participants who were independently classified in
status on two separate waves (about 4 years apart), underscoring
the validity of the CN classification and the chronicity of
the cognitively impaired classification. 

[CHUNK 1286]
Our results reflect the
challenge and relevance of considering multiple modalities
of risk, and the apparent validity of carefully characterized
groups. 

[CHUNK 1287]
The RFA results showed that seven factors (representing
five modalities) were found to be important predictors of
impairment. 

[CHUNK 1288]
The important predictors in order of significance
were PP, MCI metabolite panel, memory, novel activities, APOE,
social activities and MMSE. 

[CHUNK 1289]
Elevated PP has been linked to
cognitive impairment in MCI potentially in association with
large artery stiffness (Yaneva-Sirakova et al., 2012; McFall et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 1290]
Our previously discovered MCI metabolite panel was the
second important predictor of MCI status. 

[CHUNK 1291]
This panel could be
used in future targeted studies focusing on the differences and
early markers of early memory impairment, as distinguished
from normal memory decline. 

[CHUNK 1292]
Notably, we employed a broad
performance-based classification scheme that complements the
standard clinical approach to MCI classification (Petersen et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 1293]
Two aspects of lifestyle activities—specifically, lower
frequency of novel cognitive activities and decreased social
engagement—predicted MCI group membership, in the context
of the CN benchmark. 

[CHUNK 1294]
The discriminative associations for these
markers were in the expected direction, indicating that poorer
lifestyle activities predicted probability of cognitive impairment
(Verghese et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 1295]
As previously
reported in the literature (Brainerd et al., 2011; Dixon et al.,
2014), AD genetic risk, as represented by APOE ε4+ genotypes
predicted membership in the cognitive impairment group, in the
context of the CN benchmark. 

[CHUNK 1296]
Finally, poorer global cognition
in the MCI group, an indication of future risk of dementia
(O’Bryant et al., 2008), suggests that the MCI group maybe on an
accelerated path to dementia onset compared to the CN group.


[CHUNK 1297]
Overall, the results are consistent with the general perspective
that risk markers from multiple modalities contribute to the
prediction, classification or diagnosis of cognitive statuses such as
MCI and AD. 

[CHUNK 1298]
The results are also consistent with our expectation
that new metabolite panels, derived from salivary metabolomics
analyses, can be confirmed as among the better predictors of
clinical status—but not the only predictor, especially for the
crucial discrimination of CN and the impairment group. 

[CHUNK 1299]
Along
with notable strengths, we acknowledge several limitations. 

[CHUNK 1300]
First,
as a function of leveraging our earlier metabolomics study,
our present sample sizes are relatively small. 

[CHUNK 1301]
Although not
perfect, this fact is statistically accommodated in the machine
learning prediction analyses we used. 

[CHUNK 1302]
Specifically, RFA are
well suited to deal with small sample sizes because a large
number of trees can be used in RFA models (Strobl et al.,
2009). 

[CHUNK 1303]
Larger number of trees allows for a large variety of
predictor variable combinations to account for small sample
sizes. 

[CHUNK 1304]
Moreover, RFA outperforms other non-machine learning
techniques (i.e., regression, and factor analysis) in that it
accommodates: (1) small samples size in highly complex datasets
(Maroco et al., 2011); (2) highly correlated datasets; and (3) large
number of regression trees with specified set of predictors.


[CHUNK 1305]
The latter compensates for power issues as frequently observed
in other statistical models with small sample sizes. 

[CHUNK 1306]
We take
the average of all 5,000 trees to employ a bagged variable
importance measure—a procedure that leads to more stability
and reduces the risk of over-fitting of the data. 

[CHUNK 1307]
Nevertheless,
some over-fitting of prediction models may occur, so further
validation research is recommended. 

[CHUNK 1308]
We specifically recommend
follow-up validation studies, appropriate statistical evaluation,
and larger sample sizes. 

[CHUNK 1309]
Second, we deliberately incorporated a
large number of predictors from multiple modalities—and all are
established in a variety of independent research projects—but
not all possible and potentially relevant predictors were included.


[CHUNK 1310]
For example, future research should include other standard
AD biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid (1–42),

Multi-Modal Biomarkers and Alzheimer’s Disease
total tau, and phospho-tau-181 (Humpel, 2011), as well as
other AD-specific neuroimaging biomarkers (e.g., hippocampal
volume). 

[CHUNK 1313]
Third, in order to more broadly generalize our
results, we recommend studies recruit samples that are more
demographically diverse, include alternative biospecimens or
validate with autopsy confirmed AD cases. 

[CHUNK 1314]
As noted, the
metabolite panels used here were established in previous
metabolomics research using the same groups. 

[CHUNK 1315]
Future validation
work would also benefit from targeting and testing these panels
in different populations.


[CHUNK 1316]
We tested a multi-modal array of risk biomarkers for their
relative predictive power in discriminating three clinical status
groups. 

[CHUNK 1317]
This provides empirical evidence confirming the view
that such multi-modal approaches can be valuable in research on
neurodegenerative disease. 

[CHUNK 1318]
In addition, the results also confirm
that metabolomics procedures can produce biomarker panels
that have relevance in the competitive context of other known
risk factors for AD. 

[CHUNK 1319]
Future work should examine such novel
metabolite panels in the context of additional AD biomarkers.


[CHUNK 1320]
The results also show that modifiable risk factors can be
important predictors of clinical status, even in the context of
biomarkers from metabolomics and genomic approaches. 

[CHUNK 1321]
At
present, they appear to be especially relevant for the crucial
discrimination of normal and impaired groups. 

[CHUNK 1322]
The overall
results lead to indications of potential use for validation
and translation of non-invasive metabolite panels in pertinent
combinations with established multi-modal biomarkers for early
dementia risk detection and intervention programs. 

[CHUNK 1323]
Early and
precise risk detection can lead to personalized risk management
and other intervention strategies for older adults at elevated risk
for AD (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011; Anstey et al., 2014; Olanrewaju
et al., 2015).

Background: Recent studies have indicated that the default mode network (DMN)
comprises at least three subsystems: The medial temporal lobe (MTL) and dorsal
medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) subsystems and a core comprising the anterior
MPFC (aMPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). 

[CHUNK 2137]
Additionally, the disruption of
the DMN is related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

[CHUNK 2138]
However, little is known regarding the
changes in these subsystems in AD, a progressive disease characterized by memory
impairment. 

[CHUNK 2139]
Here, we performed a resting-state functional connectivity (FC) analysis
to test our hypothesis that the memory-related MTL subsystem was predominantly
disrupted in AD.


[CHUNK 2140]
Method: To reveal speciﬁc subsystem changes, we calculated the strength and number
of FCS in the DMN intra- and inter-subsystems across individuals and compared the
FC of the two groups. 

[CHUNK 2141]
To further examine which pairs of brain regional functional
connections contributed to the subsystem alterations, correlation coefﬁcients between
any two brain regions in the DMN were compared across groups. 

[CHUNK 2142]
Additionally, to
identify which regions made the strongest contributions to the subsystem changes, we
calculated the regional FC strength (FCS), which was compared across groups.


[CHUNK 2143]
Results: For the intra-subsystem, decreased FC number and strength occurred in the
MTL subsystem of AD patients but not in the DMPFC subsystem or core. 

[CHUNK 2144]
For the
inter-subsystems, the AD group showed decreased FCS and number between the
MTL subsystem and PCC and a decreased number between the PCC and DMPFC
subsystem. 

[CHUNK 2145]
Decreased inter-regional FCS were found within the MTL subsystem in
AD patients relative to controls: The posterior inferior parietal lobule (pIPL) showed
decreased FC with the hippocampal formation (HF), parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and
ventral MPFC (vMPFC). 

[CHUNK 2146]
Decreased inter-regional FCS of the inter-subsystems were also
found in AD patients: The HF and/or PHC showed decreased FC with dMPFC and TPJ,
located in the DMPFC subsystem, and with PCC. 

[CHUNK 2147]
AD patients also showed decreased

FC between the PCC and TLC of the dMPFC subsystem. 

[CHUNK 2150]
Furthermore, the HF and PHC
in the MTL subsystem showed decreased regional FCS.


[CHUNK 2151]
Conclusion: Decreased intrinsic FC was mainly associated with the MTL subsystem of
the AD group, suggesting that the MTL subsystem is predominantly disrupted.

INTRODUCTION
Since its name was proposed more than a decade ago (Raichle
et al., 2001), the default mode network (DMN) has been
characterized by its high level of metabolic activity during passive
states and low activity in externally directed conditions (Shulman
et al., 1997; Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Raichle et al., 2001).


[CHUNK 2153]
Additionally, the robust activity correlations within the DMN
at rest and during task performance have been conﬁrmed in
many papers (Greicius et al., 2003; Fox et al., 2005; Buckner
et al., 2008; Grigg and Grady, 2010; Spreng and Grady, 2010;
Allen et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 2154]
Although the precise function of the DMN is
still debated, most literature has revealed that the DMN shows
increased activity not only during rest but also during tasks, as
long as experimental conditions involve aspects of self-generated
thought (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014), such as autobiographical
memory (Svoboda et al., 2006; Spreng and Grady, 2010), future
projection (Addis et al., 2007), mind wandering (Christoﬀ
et al., 2009; Smallwood et al., 2013), and social cognition (Mar,
2010). 

[CHUNK 2155]
These features of self-generated thought suggest that
they comprise multiple-component processes (Andrews-Hanna
et al., 2014), which serve to prepare for upcoming events
(Baird et al., 2011), form a sense of self-identity and continuity
across time (Smallwood et al., 2011; Prebble et al., 2013), and
navigate the social world (Immordino-Yang et al., 2012; Mar
et al., 2012; Ruby et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 2156]
Recently, converging evidence
has revealed that the DMN has a parallel level of complexity
in functional-anatomical organization to support multiple-
component processes of self-generated thought (Buckner et al.,
2008; Sestieri et al., 2011; Andrews-Hanna, 2012; Kim, 2012;
Roy et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 2157]
Andrews-Hanna et al. 

[CHUNK 2158]
(2010b) explored the
intrinsic functional organization of the DMN by using functional
connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI), graph analysis
and hierarchical clustering techniques. 

[CHUNK 2159]
The authors suggested
that the DMN comprised two distinct subsystems: a dorsal
medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) subsystem consisting of
the dMPFC, the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), the lateral
temporal cortex (LTC), and the temporal pole (TempP), and
an MTL subsystem comprising the ventral medial prefrontal
cortex (vMPFC), the posterior inferior parietal lobule (pIPL), the
retrosplenial cortex (Rsp), the hippocampal formation (HF), and
the parahippocampal cortex (PHC). 

[CHUNK 2160]
Both subsystems converge
on a core that includes the anterior MPFC (aMPFC) and the
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). 

[CHUNK 2161]
The authors then proved that
the two subsystems had relatively distinct functions by designing
an experiment. 

[CHUNK 2162]
The DMPFC subsystem was preferentially
activated during decisions about one’s present situation or mental
state, and the MTL subsystem was selectively activated during
self-relevant predictions about one’s future.


[CHUNK 2163]
Previous work has consistently shown that compared with
healthy subjects, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have
reduced FC within the DMN when at rest (Greicius et al., 2004;
Rombouts et al., 2005; Celone et al., 2006; Wang K. et al.,
2006) and less pronounced deactivation during cognitive tasks
(Lustig et al., 2003; Celone et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 2164]
In addition, several
studies of cortical hubs that performed functional and structural
connectivity analysis combined with graph theoretical analysis
revealed that most of the hubs are located within the DMN,
such as the PCC, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and
the HF (Hagmann et al., 2008; Buckner et al., 2009; Yu et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 2165]
It has been suggested that these cortical hubs in the
DMN are preferentially aﬀected in AD (Yu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 2166]
The
abovementioned studies have suggested that DMN impairment is
related to AD. 

[CHUNK 2167]
Moreover, although several studies have found that
reductions in FC only exist in some regions, such as the PCC and
the medial temporal lobe (MTL), in patients with AD (Zhou et al.,
2008; Bai et al., 2009), other studies have reported widespread
reductions in FC as the disease progresses (Damoiseaux et al.,
2012). 

[CHUNK 2168]
AD is a progressive dementia, and the predominant
symptom is memory impairment, although disturbances in other
cognitive functions also occur (Krajcovicova et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 2169]
Based
on the above ﬁndings, distinct subsystems in the DMN engage in
diﬀerential cognitive processes involving memory construction
and self-oriented cognition, and these cognitive processes are
inﬂuenced by AD (Greicius et al., 2004; Buckner et al., 2008, 2009;
Zhou et al., 2010; Menon, 2011). 

[CHUNK 2170]
Therefore, we hypothesized
that the memory-related MTL subsystem was predominantly
disrupted in AD and that other subsystems in the DMN may be
disrupted to a certain degree. 

[CHUNK 2171]
To test these hypotheses, rs-fMRI
was performed on 24 patients with mild to moderate AD and
on 27 healthy elderly subjects. 

[CHUNK 2172]
Eleven regions of interest (ROIs)
in the DMN subsystem for FC analysis were selected based on
published data by Andrews-Hanna et al. 

[CHUNK 2173]
(2010b). 

[CHUNK 2174]
The DMN FC
matrices were constructed by estimating the Pearson correlation
between the time series of pairs of ROIs in the subsystems. 

[CHUNK 2175]
To
reveal the speciﬁc disrupted subsystem, we analyzed the strength
and number of FCS in the intra- and inter-subsystems of the
DMN. 

[CHUNK 2176]
Then, to examine which pairs of regional FCS contributed
to changes in the subsystems, each pair of correlation coeﬃcients
in the DMN was compared across groups.


[CHUNK 2177]
In the present study, a regional FCS analysis was also used
to identify regions that made the strongest contributions to the
changes in the subsystems. 

[CHUNK 2178]
Regional FCS is deﬁned as the mean
of the correlation strength of one ROI with all other target regions
in a brain network and is referred to as the “degree centrality” of a

Brain ROIs with higher FCS values

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A total of 55 subjects were enrolled from Shanghai Huashan
Hospital. 

[CHUNK 2183]
All participants were categorized into a control group
(n = 27) and an AD patient group (n = 28). 

[CHUNK 2184]
AD patients were
diagnosed by a qualiﬁed neurologist using criteria for amnestic
AD (Fennema-Notestine et al., 2009), with mini-mental state
examination (MMSE) scores between 12 and 27 (inclusive) and
clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores of 1 or 2. 

[CHUNK 2185]
The control
groups had MMSE scores between 26 and 30 (inclusive) and
CDR scores of 0. 

[CHUNK 2186]
The data of 4 subjects (4 patients with AD)
were excluded due to excessive motion, severe brain atrophy,
hydrocephalus or large areas of cerebral infarction. 

[CHUNK 2187]
Details
regarding the clinical and demographic data of the remaining
51 subjects are shown in Table 1. 

[CHUNK 2188]
There were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in terms of sex or age between the two groups.


[CHUNK 2189]
Image Acquisition and Preprocessing
All subjects underwent whole-brain MRI scanning on a 3.0T
SIEMENS Verio. 

[CHUNK 2190]
Resting-state BOLD functional MRI data
were collected using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence.


[CHUNK 2191]
The scanning parameters were TR = 2000 ms, TE = 35 ms,
FOV = 25.6 cm × 25.6 cm, ﬂip angle = 90◦, matrix = 256 × 256,
slices = 33, thickness = 4 mm, and gap = 4 mm.


[CHUNK 2192]
Unless speciﬁcally stated otherwise, all of the preprocessing
was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM81).


[CHUNK 2193]
The
ﬁrst
5
images
were
discarded
in
consideration
of
magnetization equilibrium. 

[CHUNK 2194]
The remaining 155 images were
corrected for the acquisition time delay among diﬀerent slices,
and then, the images were realigned to the ﬁrst volume for
head-motion correction. 

[CHUNK 2195]
The fMRI images were further spatially
normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
EPI template and resampled to a 2-mm cubic voxel. 

[CHUNK 2196]
Several
sources of spurious variance, including the estimated motion
parameters, the linear drift, and the average time series in the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid and white matter regions, were removed from
the data through linear regression.

ﬁltering (0.03–0.06 HZ) was performed to reduce the eﬀects of
low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise (Liu et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2202]
The time course of head motion was obtained
by estimating the translations in each direction and the rotations
in angular motion about each axis for each of the 155 consecutive
volumes. 

[CHUNK 2203]
All of the subjects included in this study exhibited a
maximum displacement of less than 3 mm (smaller than the size
of a voxel in plane) at each axis and an angular motion of less
than 3 for each axis. 

[CHUNK 2204]
Data from two subjects were excluded due
to excessive motion.


[CHUNK 2205]
Functional Connectivity Analysis
fcMRI was performed using REST2 (Song et al., 2011) to extract
the time series for each ROI (spherical radius of 4 mm) (Table 2)
by averaging the time courses of all voxels within an ROI.


[CHUNK 2206]
For each subject, we ﬁrst calculated a Pearson’s correlation
and the signiﬁcance level (i.e., p-value) between all given

Then, we obtained an 11 × 11 symmetric correlation
matrix and the corresponding p-value matrix for each subject.


[CHUNK 2208]
To eliminate unreliable correlations, we retained only those
correlations whose corresponding p-values met a statistical
threshold p < 0.001 (0.05/55, Bonferroni correction); otherwise,
we set the correlations to zero (Cruse et al., 2011; Wang et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 2209]
Then, correlation coeﬃcients in a weighted 11 × 11
FC matrix were converted into z-values with the application of
Fisher’s r-to-z transformation. 

[CHUNK 2210]
Fisher’s Z-transformed correlation
matrix was used for the subsequent analysis of each subject.

The strength of the intra-subsystem FCS was deﬁned as the

FCS was deﬁned as the total and mean of the positive-only
FCS between any two ROIs of the two selected subsystems.

DMN Subsystem’s Disruption in AD
across groups using two-sample t-tests. 

[CHUNK 2218]
We also analyzed the
diﬀerences in the numbers of positive-only FCS of the intra- and
inter-subsystems between two groups using two-sample t-tests.


[CHUNK 2219]
Notably, to explore the speciﬁc changes in FC between the core
regions and subsystems, we calculated the number and strength
of FCS between the two core regions and subsystems separately.


[CHUNK 2220]
To examine which pairs of brain regional FCS contributed
to the alterations in the subsystems of the DMN in AD, the
correlation coeﬃcients between any two ROIs in the DMN
were also compared across groups using two-sample t-tests with
false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 

[CHUNK 2221]
We also listed the results
with p-values less than 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 to ﬁnd possible
diﬀerences in physiological signiﬁcance. 

[CHUNK 2222]
Furthermore, to identify
which regions made the highest contributions to the changes in
the subsystems, we compared the regional FCS across groups
by using two-sample t-tests. 

[CHUNK 2223]
The FCS of a given region was
calculated using the following equation (Buckner et al., 2009; Zuo
et al., 2012; Wang L. et al., 2013):

where N is the number of ROIs in the DMN (here N = 11), rij
zij is the Fisher Z-transformed correlation coeﬃcient, rijis the
correlation coeﬃcient between ROI i and ROI j, and r0 is a
correlation threshold that was used to eliminate weak correlations
possibly derived from noise (here, r0 = 0). 

[CHUNK 2224]
The diﬀerence in
regional FCS between the two groups revealed regions that were
disrupted in patients with AD.


[CHUNK 2225]
The Effects of Different Analysis
Strategies
In our study, an FC matrix included positive and negative
connections. 

[CHUNK 2226]
In the positive-only strategy, we analyzed FC
matrices by using the positive-only inter-regional FCS. 

[CHUNK 2227]
For
example, we assumed that no inter-regional FC existed if the
inter-regional FC was non-positive. 

[CHUNK 2228]
Given the controversies in
the treatment of negative correlations in rs-fMRI network studies
(Fox et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2015), we also
calculated the strengths and numbers of positive and negative
FCS of the intra- and inter-subsystems for the two groups
and performed an FCS analysis including both positive and
negative (absolute values) connections to assess the stability of
our ﬁndings.

RESULTS
Group Differences in the Strengths and
Numbers of FCS of the Subsystems and
Core
To explore speciﬁc changes in the subsystems in AD patients,
the total and mean FC strengths of the intra- and inter-
subsystems of the DMN were calculated. 

[CHUNK 2230]
Diﬀerent analysis
strategies consistently produced the same results. 

[CHUNK 2231]
In this study,
we show the results of the positive-only strategy.


[CHUNK 2232]
The results of the former method are as follows: Patients
with AD showed decreased total FC strength (FCS) in the
two subsystems (see Figure 1A) between core regions and
subsystems and between subsystems relative to the controls (see
Figure 1B). 

[CHUNK 2233]
Two-sample t-tests were performed to statically
analyze the diﬀerences between the AD group and the control
group. 

[CHUNK 2234]
Signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the two groups were found
in the MTL subsystem (t(49) = −3.00, p = 0.004) but not in
the core (t(49) = 0.77, p = 0.45) or the DMPFC subsystem
(t(49) = −1.31, p = 0.20). 

[CHUNK 2235]
Signiﬁcantly decreased total FCS
was also found between the PCC and the MTL subsystem
(t(49) = −2.41, p = 0.02) but not found between the subsystems
(t(49) = −1.64, p = 0.11), between the PCC and the dMPFC
subsystem (t(49) = −1.33, p = 0.19), between the amPFC and the
dMPFC subsystem (t(49) = 0.77, p = 0.44), or between the amPFC
and the MTL subsystem (t(49) = −1.01, p = 0.32). 

[CHUNK 2236]
For total FCS
in the core, stronger correlations were observed in the AD group,
although not signiﬁcant (see Figure 1A). 

[CHUNK 2237]
However, there was
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the mean strength of the FC of the
inter- and intra-subsystems (see Figures 2A,B) between the two
groups. 

[CHUNK 2238]
For the FC matrix of each subject, we also calculated the
total number of intra- and inter-subsystem FCS (see Figure 3).


[CHUNK 2239]
The statistical analysis (two-sample t-tests) revealed that the AD
group showed a signiﬁcantly smaller total number of FCS in
the MTL subsystem (t(49) = 3.74, p = 0.0005) (see Figure 3A).


[CHUNK 2240]
Moreover, a signiﬁcantly reduced number of FCS was also found
between the PCC and the MTL subsystem (t(49) = 3.12, p = 0.003)
and between the PCC and the DMPFC subsystem (t(49) = 2.47,
p = 0.02) (see Figure 3B) in AD patients relative to controls.


[CHUNK 2241]
Group Differences in the Inter-Regional
FCS of the DMN
To examine which pairs of brain regional correlation coeﬃcients
contributed to the alteration in the subsystems of the DMN,
correlation coeﬃcients between pairs of ROIs in the DMN for
each subject were compared across groups (see Figure 4). 

[CHUNK 2242]
As
shown in Figure 4, weaker correlations between ROIs in the
DMN were observed in the AD group relative to the control
group. 

[CHUNK 2243]
Fewer inter-regional FCS were found within the MTL
subsystem of AD patients than within that of controls: pIPL
showed low FC with the hippocampus, the PHC and the vMPFC.


[CHUNK 2244]
In addition, fewer pairs of brain regional FCS of the inter-
subsystems were found in AD patients. 

[CHUNK 2245]
The hippocampus and the
PHC showed decreased FC with the TPJ and the dMPFC, both of
which were located in the DMPFC subsystem and the PCC. 

[CHUNK 2246]
The
PCC also showed decreased FC with the TLC, which exists in the
dMPFC subsystem in AD. 

[CHUNK 2247]
The functional connection between
the hippocampus and the PCC is the only connection that was
retained after FDR correction.


[CHUNK 2248]
The Most Signiﬁcantly Disrupted
Regions Measured by FCS
To identify which regions made the strongest contributions
to the changes in subsystems of the DMN, the diﬀerences in
the regional FCS between the two groups were measured (see
Figure 5).

Here, we present the results of the positive-

[CHUNK 2257]
Between-group comparison analysis (two-sample
t-tests) revealed that regions showing the most signiﬁcant group
diﬀerences in FCS were the HF (t(49) = 2.76, p = 0.008) and the
PHC (t(49) = 2.28, p = 0.03).


[CHUNK 2258]
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that the memory-related MTL subsystem
is predominantly disrupted in AD. 

[CHUNK 2259]
First, we explored the
changes in FC of the intra- and inter-subsystems in patients
with AD. 

[CHUNK 2260]
The strength and number of FCS were signiﬁcantly
decreased, speciﬁcally in the MTL subsystems but not in the
core or the DMPFC subsystem. 

[CHUNK 2261]
Moreover, the strength and
number of FCS were signiﬁcantly decreased between the MTL
subsystems and the PCC. 

[CHUNK 2262]
We also examined which pairs of brain
regional functional connections contributed to the changes in
the subsystems and found that the HF and the PHC showed
extensively decreased FCS with other regions in the DMN.


[CHUNK 2263]
Furthermore, we identiﬁed the HF and the PHC as making
the strongest contributions to the alterations in the subsystems.


[CHUNK 2264]
Additionally, our data show that in addition to the changes in the
MTL subsystem, the core and DMPFC subsystems in the default
network also have some degree of disruption. 

[CHUNK 2265]
A signiﬁcantly
decreased number of FCS between the core and the DMPFC
subsystem was found in AD patients. 

[CHUNK 2266]
Inter-regional FC analysis
revealed that there are a few pairs of decreased brain regional FCS
between the subsystems and between the core and the dMPFC in
patients with AD.


[CHUNK 2267]
Predominantly Disrupted
Memory-Related Subsystems in Patients
With AD
As consistently reported in the literature, the MTL subsystem
is reliably activated when engaged in autobiographical memory
and episodic future thought (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 2268]
These spontaneous thoughts may allow individuals to construct
and simulate scenarios, mentally organize their plans, and
prepare for what may lie ahead (Immordino-Yang et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 2269]
Additionally, spontaneous thoughts may facilitate consolidation
of the most self-relevant information into long-term memory.


[CHUNK 2270]
In the present study, we found that the MTL subsystem is
predominantly disrupted. 

[CHUNK 2271]
Within the MTL subsystem, the PIPL
showed decreased FC with the HF, the PHC and the vMPFC.


[CHUNK 2272]
This ﬁnding was supported by the research of Wang L. et al.


[CHUNK 2273]
(2006) and Wang Z. et al. 

[CHUNK 2274]
(2013). 

[CHUNK 2275]
The HF and the PHC located
in the MTL subsystem were mostly disrupted in AD patients.


[CHUNK 2276]
Consistent with our ﬁndings, previous researchers have proposed
that pathological amyloid depositions and atrophy in AD patients
are located in cortical regions such as the HF and the PHC
(Buckner et al., 2005, 2009; Stricker et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2277]
fMRI studies
have revealed that AD patients have reduced activity in regions
of the DMN.

(2004) found decreased resting-
state activity in the hippocampus of AD patients.

[CHUNK 2291]
the HF possibly play signiﬁcant roles in the MTL subsystem
because the cognitive processes in which the MTL subsystem is
involved might be supported by the MTL (including the PHC
and the HF), which dynamically interacts with cortical regions
within and outside the default network. 

[CHUNK 2292]
Recent studies have
supported the possibility of resting MTL activity or MTL-cortical
FC related to individual diﬀerences in spontaneous episodic
thoughts (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010a), memory ability (Wig
et al., 2008), and the consolidation of recent experiences (Tambini
et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 2293]
Thus, the changes in the FC of the HF and the
PHC in the DMN probably reﬂect cognitive impairment in
recent episodic memory. 

[CHUNK 2294]
Our ﬁndings support the hypothesis
that the memory-related MTL subsystem of the DMN is primarily
disrupted in AD.


[CHUNK 2295]
In addition to the changes within the MTL subsystem itself,
in the present study, we found that the MTL subsystem also
showed decreased number and strength of FCS with the PCC
in patients with AD. 

[CHUNK 2296]
A number of studies have also suggested
that the PCC plays an essential role in spatial orientation, self-
appraisal and internal monitoring as well as memory processing
(Gusnard and Raichle, 2001; Greicius et al., 2003; Whishaw
and Wallace, 2003; Ries et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 2297]
As the core of the DMN,
the PCC, which exhibits strong functional coherence with both
subsystems (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014) in coordination with
the MTL subsystems, may facilitate memory processing. 

[CHUNK 2298]
As
consistently reported in previous literature, in the early stage of
AD, FC between the PCC and the hippocampus, the anterior
cingulate cortex, the MPFC and the precuneus are disrupted
(Greicius et al., 2004; Wang L. et al., 2006; Sorg et al., 2007).


[CHUNK 2299]
It is possible that impairment between the PCC and the MTL
subsystem may damage memory processing. 

[CHUNK 2300]
These ﬁndings
indicate that AD predominantly disrupts the memory-related
MTL subsystem.


[CHUNK 2301]
More Extensive Disruption of
Subsystems in Patients With AD
In addition to the predominantly decreased FC associated
with the memory-related MTL subsystem, we also found more
extensively reduced FC in the inter-subsystems. 

[CHUNK 2302]
Compared with
the control group, the number of FCS between the PCC and
the DMPFC subsystem was signiﬁcantly reduced in AD, and
inter-regional FC revealed that a few pairs of brain regional
FCS between the subsystems and between the core region and
the dMPFC subsystem exhibited signiﬁcant decreases in the
AD group. 

[CHUNK 2303]
In line with our ﬁndings, previous studies have
found that dissociated FC occurs between the PCC and the
inferior temporal cortex in AD patients (Zhang et al., 2010).


[CHUNK 2304]
AD patients also have decreased hippocampus connectivity with
the TPJ (Greicius et al., 2004) and the MPFC (Grady, 2001).


[CHUNK 2305]
These results provide powerful evidence for the possibility of the
deterioration of all subsystems of the DMN as AD progresses,
and previous studies support this possibility.

DMN Subsystem’s Disruption in AD

[CHUNK 2332]
Error bars represent the standard error of the

[CHUNK 2333]
posterior DMN, including the PCC/Rsp, the IPL, and the LTC
(Buckner et al., 2005), begin to disengage their connectivity;
however, as the disease progresses, connectivity within all systems
eventually deteriorates (Damoiseaux et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2334]
Zhang et al.


[CHUNK 2335]
(2010) suggested that impairment in the PCC FC changes
with AD progression. 

[CHUNK 2336]
In contrast to the constructive functions
of the MTL subsystem, the DMPFC subsystem may play
an important role in examining the mental states of social
agents (Andrews-Hanna, 2012), including the ability to reﬂect
on, evaluate, or appraise social information. 

[CHUNK 2337]
The PCC shares
functional properties with both subsystems, possibly interacting
with the DMPFC to facilitate examination of the mental
state. 

[CHUNK 2338]
The DMN subsystems supporting component processes
of self-generated thought work together but independently to
complete internal information processing and ultimately guide
and motivate behavior. 

[CHUNK 2339]
For example, the DMPFC subsystem
may allow individuals to reﬂect on the mental states elicited by
the stimulus, and the MTL subsystem may allow individuals to
integrate this introspective information into a goal-directed plan
(Andrews-Hanna, 2012). 

[CHUNK 2340]
Therefore, more extensive disruption
of the subsystems of the DMN in patients with AD in the
DMN may account for additional cognitive impairments other
than memory deﬁcits to some degree. 

[CHUNK 2341]
Our ﬁndings support
previous studies indicating that the DMN is an important
target network to be impaired (Buckner et al., 2009) and
specify that diﬀerent subsystems of the default network are
not equivalently damaged in AD but that memory-related MTL
subsystems are selectively damaged. 

[CHUNK 2342]
As the disease progresses,
other subsystems of the DMN may also have a certain degree of
damage.


[CHUNK 2343]
Limitations
Several limitations in the present work should be considered.


[CHUNK 2344]
First, our study had a small sample size. 

[CHUNK 2345]
Second, our research
focused only on subjects with mild to moderate AD, which did
not allow us to determine the speciﬁc changes in the DMN
subsystems during diﬀerent stages of the disease. 

[CHUNK 2346]
Third, we
did not perform related behavioral tests. 

[CHUNK 2347]
Speciﬁc self-referential
cognitive ability changes in AD patients may be related to the
corresponding FC in the DMN subsystems. 

[CHUNK 2348]
Four, our processing
of the functional matrix of each subject may remove some of
the weaker connections that are actually present. 

[CHUNK 2349]
Considering
these limitations, future work should involve a longitudinal study
(i.e., from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to mild, moderate,
and serious AD) and include more participants in each group to
enhance stability of the results. 

[CHUNK 2350]
In addition, we should explore
the relationship between the changes in the DMN subsystems in
the functional and structural network and speciﬁc self-referential
cognitive ability. 

[CHUNK 2351]
Furthermore, we will explore more reasonable
ways to implement our research.


[CHUNK 2352]
CONCLUSION
In summary, this study shows that the memory-related MTL
subsystem of the DMN is predominantly disrupted in patients
with AD and further that the core and DMPFC subsystems in
the DMN are also disrupted to some degree. 

[CHUNK 2353]
These ﬁndings
indicate the diﬀerent levels of disruption of distinct subsystems
of the DMN, possibly providing novel insight into the potential
pathogenesis of AD and a possible imaging biomarker for the
early diagnosis of AD.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the development of amyloid plaques
and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) and tau,
respectively. 

[CHUNK 2758]
The amyloid hypothesis has been the predominant framework for research
in AD for over two decades. 

[CHUNK 2759]
According to this hypothesis, the accumulation of Aβ in
the brain is the primary factor initiating the pathogenesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 2760]
However, it remains
elusive what factors initiate Aβ aggregation. 

[CHUNK 2761]
Studies demonstrate that AD has multiple
causes, including genetic and environmental factors. 

[CHUNK 2762]
Furthermore, genetic factors, many
age-related events and pathological conditions such as diabetes, traumatic brain injury
(TBI) and aberrant microbiota also affect the aggregation of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 2763]
Here we provide an
overview of the age-related early events and other pathological processes that precede
Aβ aggregation.

Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, β-amyloid, aggregation, age, diabetes
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia in the elderly. 

[CHUNK 2765]
By 2030, the world’s
AD population will reach more than 70 million (McDade and Bateman, 2017). 

[CHUNK 2766]
But no effective
treatments can prevent, halt, or reverse AD so far. 

[CHUNK 2767]
Pathologically, AD is characterized by the
assemblies of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and cytoplasmic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs)
consisting of the microtubule-associated protein tau (Braak and Braak, 1991).


[CHUNK 2768]
Aβ is generated by the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the much larger amyloid precursor
protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase. 

[CHUNK 2769]
In contrast, cleavage of APP by α-secretase precludes
Aβ formation. 

[CHUNK 2770]
The exact physiological function of Aβ remains unknown. 

[CHUNK 2771]
In AD brain, Aβ
adopts a highly ordered structure known as cross-β spine, or amyloid (Lührs et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 2772]
Many
studies have shown a causal relationship between Aβ and the pathogenesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 2773]
The NFTs
mainly consist of aggregated tau that bears abnormal posttranslational modifications, including
hyperphosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitylation, truncation and so on. 

[CHUNK 2774]
Compared to Aβ, tau
deposits correlates better with the degree of cognitive impairment (Goedert and Spillantini, 2006).


[CHUNK 2775]
It is believed that tau functions primarily to stabilize microtubes, and its aggregation in AD causes
deficits through a loss-of-function mechanism (Morris et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 2776]
However, recent studies
have shown that tau may promote or enhance excitatory neurotransmission by modulating the
distribution of synaptic activity-related signaling molecules (Morris et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 2777]
Currently, the predominant framework of AD research is the amyloid hypothesis.


[CHUNK 2778]
According to the amyloid hypothesis (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002), Aβ is the pathological
factor that initiates the onset and progression of AD. 

[CHUNK 2779]
Thus, Aβ is proposed to be the
target of primary prevention trials (McDade and Bateman, 2017). 

[CHUNK 2780]
However, what initially

Zhang et al.


[CHUNK 2782]
Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
triggers the aggregation and accumulation of Aβ in AD is
unclear. 

[CHUNK 2783]
To stop the disease before it starts, we should find
the earlier events that precede Aβ aggregation. 

[CHUNK 2784]
This review
highlights the relationship between risk factors of AD and Aβ
aggregation to bring us closer to a comprehensive understanding
of the pathogenesis of AD and prevention potential of early
events in AD.


[CHUNK 2785]
ASSEMBLY OF Aβ
Aβ is 40–42 amino acids in length and is formed by proteolytic
cleavage of the much larger APP. 

[CHUNK 2786]
APP is a transmembrane
protein with a single membrane-spanning domain (Glenner
and Wong, 1984a,b; Masters et al., 1985), which may have a
trophic function (Thornton et al., 2006; Weyer et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 2787]
APP can be cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase generating
the N terminus and the C terminus of Aβ respectively. 

[CHUNK 2788]
During
the amyloidogenic process, APP is first cleaved by β-secretase
to release the C-terminal fragment (C99), and then C99 is
further cleaved by γ-secretase to generate Aβ. 

[CHUNK 2789]
In contrast,
cleaved by α-secretase precluding Aβ formation. 

[CHUNK 2790]
C99 is cleaved
at different sites by γ-secretase, resulting in different Aβ profiles
(Acx et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 2791]
The major species of Aβ profiles are
40 or 42 amino acids long, and Aβ42 is more aggregation-
prone and believed to be the toxic building block of Aβ
assemblies.


[CHUNK 2792]
Aβ adopts a highly ordered structure known as cross-β
spine or amyloid (Lührs et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 2793]
The formation of Aβ
fibrils can be divided into three phase including nucleation
phase, elongation phase and stationary phase (Iadanza et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 2794]
In nucleation phase, oligomeric Aβ forms a nucleus,
which can recruit other monomers. 

[CHUNK 2795]
As fibrils grow, they can
shatter, producing new aggregation-prone species to elongate
the fibril. 

[CHUNK 2796]
Until nearly all free monomer is converted into
a fibrillar form, a variety of insoluble fibrils, oligomers and
soluble monomer achieve dynamic balance in the stationary
phase. 

[CHUNK 2797]
Oligomers are considered to be more pathogenic
than mature fiber. 

[CHUNK 2798]
However, which Aβ assemblies are most
pathogenic is unresolved (Benilova et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2799]
The fibrils
also associate with each other, with other proteins, and with
non-proteinaceous factors to form the plaques (Stewart et al.,
2017).


[CHUNK 2800]
Aβ plaques first develop in one or more parts of the basal
temporal and orbitofrontal neocortex (Braak and Braak, 1991;
Thal et al., 2002; Braak and Del Trecidi, 2015). 

[CHUNK 2801]
They were
then observed throughout the neocortex, in the hippocampal
formation, amygdala, diencephalon and basal ganglia. 

[CHUNK 2802]
In severe
AD cases, Aβ brain plaque also appears in the mesencephalon,
lower brainstem and cerebellar cortex.


[CHUNK 2803]
Multiple lines of evidence indicate that APP and Aβ
contribute causally to the pathogenesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 2804]
However, the
function of Aβ remains confused. 

[CHUNK 2805]
There is evidence that
Aβ regulates neuronal and synaptic activity, and that Aβ
accumulation in the brain leads to a combination of abnormal
network activity and synaptic depression, which can result in
excitotoxicity (Palop and Mucke, 2010). 

[CHUNK 2806]
Recent studies suggest
that Aβ is an antimicrobial peptide, which may play a protective
role in innate immunity, and infectious or sterile inflammatory
stimuli may drive amyloidosis (Kumar et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 2807]
THE AMYLOID HYPOTHESIS AND THE
PRION HYPOTHESIS
The Amyloid Hypothesis
In 1992, Hardy and Higgins (1992) postulated that ‘‘Aβ . 

[CHUNK 2808]
. 

[CHUNK 2809]
. 

[CHUNK 2810]
is the
causative agent in AD pathology and that NFTs, cell loss, vascular
damage and dementia follow as a direct result of this deposition.’’
This hypothesis has dominated the AD field for more than
two decades. 

[CHUNK 2811]
A variety of clinical and laboratory evidence
supports the hypothesis. 

[CHUNK 2812]
The most reliable data supporting the
initiator role of Aβ come from genetic studies. 

[CHUNK 2813]
The mutations
of APP, presenilin-1 (PS1), and PS2, which are involved in Aβ
production, cause the autosomal dominant familial AD (fAD;
Bettens et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 2814]
Besides, duplication of the APP locus on
chromosome 21 in Down syndrome cause age-related dementia
with brain parenchymal Aβ deposits (Prasher et al., 1998;
Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 2815]
Moreover, a rare APP mutation is
protective against dementia because it inhibits the production of
Aβ and the development of plaques in the brain (Jonsson et al.,
2012).


[CHUNK 2816]
There are also some observations that do not fit easily with
the amyloid hypothesis. 

[CHUNK 2817]
The main objections can be summed
up as the anatomical and temporal discord between Aβ plaque
deposition, neuronal death and clinical symptoms in AD (Musiek
and Holtzman, 2015). 

[CHUNK 2818]
Early neuronal loss regions (entorhinal
cortex and hippocampus) are consistent more closely with tau
pathology regions than Aβ deposition site (precuneus and frontal
lobes), both spatially and temporally (Arriagada et al., 1992;
Musiek and Holtzman, 2015). 

[CHUNK 2819]
This anatomic disconnection is
still not fully explained. 

[CHUNK 2820]
However, some studies suggest that the
appearance of high-grade cortical tau pathology requires the
presence of Aβ aggregation (Price and Morris, 1999; Knopman
et al., 2003; Petersen et al., 2006) and tau-mediated toxicity
requires trigger from Aβ (West et al., 1994; Gómez-Isla et al.,
1996). 

[CHUNK 2821]
As for the temporal discrepancy, the neuropathology
occurring before symptom onset can be explained as a preclinical
AD (Bateman et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2822]
It is well-accepted that Aβ plays a key
role in AD, but it does not exert its effects in a vacuum. 

[CHUNK 2823]
The Aβ
toxicity involves a complicated network (Musiek and Holtzman,
2015).


[CHUNK 2824]
The Prion Hypothesis
The
amyloid
hypothesis
cannot
adequately
explain
the
progression of Aβ pathology over a long distance. 

[CHUNK 2825]
The recent
surge of studies shows the misfolded proteins, such as Aβ and
tau, have prion-like properties. 

[CHUNK 2826]
Therefore, the prion hypothesis
was proposed to explain how amyloid aggregates propagate
through anatomically connected brain areas. 

[CHUNK 2827]
According to the
prion hypothesis, Aβ and tau are similar to prion in the cross-β
quaternary structure, the mechanism of self-propagation and
cell-to-cell transmission, and the ability to form structurally
diverse fibrils (strains; Guo and Lee, 2014).

formation can be divided into two processes, a slow nucleation

Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
phase (the aggregation of the protein into seeds) and a growth
phase (the growing fibril break to generate and spread new
amyloid seeds; Jucker and Walker, 2013). 

[CHUNK 2831]
Also, this seeding
process could be homologous or heterologous (Morales et al.,
2009), which means oligomers composed of one misfolded
protein can promote the polymerization of another protein. 

[CHUNK 2832]
This
process is termed as ‘‘cross-seeding,’’ which may play an essential
and yet uncovered role in the origin of AD.


[CHUNK 2833]
WHAT INITIATES Aβ AGGREGATION?


[CHUNK 2834]
Genotype of Protein
fAD: APP, PS1, Down Syndrome
Although the cases of fAD account for only less than 1% of
total AD, the research of fAD helps us to discover the causative
gene defects, including APP and PS1. 

[CHUNK 2835]
APP gene is located on
chromosome 21. 

[CHUNK 2836]
It is well-known that APP gene mutations,
duplication of its gene or trisomy of chromosome 21 (Down’s
syndrome) cause fAD (Prasher et al., 1998). 

[CHUNK 2837]
Thirty-nine missense
mutations in the APP gene have been described in individuals
from Early-onset fAD (Wang Q. et al., 2015), most of which are
inside or surrounds the Aβ area. 

[CHUNK 2838]
APP mutations either increase
total Aβ production or lead to an increased proportion of Aβ42
(Citron et al., 1992; Suzuki et al., 1994). 

[CHUNK 2839]
PS1 or PS2 is the catalytic
subunit of the γ-secretase protein complex. 

[CHUNK 2840]
Mutations in PS1 are
the most frequent cause of fAD. 

[CHUNK 2841]
The mutations increase the ratio
of Aβ42 to Aβ40, which may result from reduced γ-secretase
activity (Citron et al., 1997).


[CHUNK 2842]
sAD: ApoE, BIN1 and TREM2
Most cases of AD are sporadic. 

[CHUNK 2843]
Inherited forms of the ε4 allele
of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) was identified as a major genetic
risk factor for sAD. 

[CHUNK 2844]
Furthermore, the bridging integrator 1
(BIN1 or amphiphysin2) is the second most important genetic
susceptibility locus in late-onset AD after ApoE4 (Tan et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 2845]
Recently, rare mutations in triggering receptor expressed
on myeloid cells (TREM2) has received much attention, because
one of its variants, R47H, is reported to increase the risk for
LOAD by 2–3 folds (Guerreiro et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 2846]
ApoE
ApoE is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 34.2 kDa
(Mahley, 1988), which has three isoforms, ApoE2, ApoE3 and
ApoE4, in humans (Mahley and Huang, 2006). 

[CHUNK 2847]
ApoE is mainly
expressed in brain and liver. 

[CHUNK 2848]
Astrocytes and neurons have
long been recognized as the primary source of ApoE in the
brain (Huang, 2006). 

[CHUNK 2849]
The primary role of ApoE is to transport
lipids and cholesterol in the body. 

[CHUNK 2850]
Besides, ApoE also plays
a role in mediating synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and
neuroinflammation (Holtzman et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2851]
Corder et al. 

[CHUNK 2852]
(1993)
reported that subjects with an ApoE ε4 allele had an earlier onset
clinical dementia in families with AD. 

[CHUNK 2853]
Poirier et al. 

[CHUNK 2854]
(1993) further
confirmed the association in a case-control study of sporadic
AD. 

[CHUNK 2855]
This conclusion was supported by a series of other reports
(Amouyel et al., 1993; Noguchi et al., 1993; Myers et al., 1996),
making the ApoE ε4 allele the most important genetic risk factor
for AD. 

[CHUNK 2856]
In contrast to APP, PS1 and PS2, the presence of ApoE
ε4 is not sufficient to cause the disease. 

[CHUNK 2857]
Indeed, despite decades of
research, the pathophysiological pathway linking ApoE4 to AD
remains unclear. 

[CHUNK 2858]
To date, the studies suggest that ApoE4 may
promote the pathogenesis of AD via Aβ-dependent and Aβ-
independent mechanisms.


[CHUNK 2859]
Aβ-Dependent Mechanisms.


[CHUNK 2860]
ApoE is associated with the
formation of amyloid plaques. 

[CHUNK 2861]
Lipid-free ApoE3 and ApoE4 can
form stable complexes with Aβ peptides. 

[CHUNK 2862]
ApoE4 forms complexes
with Aβ more efficiently and rapidly than ApoE3 (Huang
and Mahley, 2006). 

[CHUNK 2863]
Further studies have shown that ApoE
binds to residues 12–28 of Aβ and this binding modulates
Aβ accumulation, hence affecting disease progression. 

[CHUNK 2864]
Peptides
that interrupt ApoE/Aβ binding reduced Aβ-related pathology
and cognitive improvements in an APP/PS1 transgenic AD
mouse model (Liu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 2865]
On the other hand, lipidated
ApoE3 binds Aβ with higher affinity than ApoE4 (Huang and
Mahley, 2006), and further studies (Kim et al., 2009) demonstrate
that altering ApoE lipidation changes its ability to mediate Aβ
clearance or deposition in the brain. 

[CHUNK 2866]
Furthermore, recent data
describe a novel signal transduction pathway in neurons whereby
ApoE activates a non-canonical MAP kinase cascade that
enhances APP transcription and amyloid-β synthesis (Huang
et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 2867]
It has been reported that human ApoE regulates Aβ clearance.


[CHUNK 2868]
ApoE2 and ApoE3 clear Aβ more efficiently than ApoE4 (Bales
et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 2869]
Also, a C-terminally truncated ApoE4 was found in
AD brain, which inefficiently removes Aβ and acts in concert
with Aβ to elicit neuronal and behavioral deficits in transgenic
mice (Bien-Ly et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 2870]
Overall, ApoE4 may initiate Aβ
accumulation through binding with Aβ and decreasing its
clearance. 

[CHUNK 2871]
Interesting, Wisniewski et al. 

[CHUNK 2872]
(1995) isolated Aβ from
senile plaques and found that a carboxyl-terminal fragment
of ApoE was co-purified. 

[CHUNK 2873]
In vitro, this fragment could form
amyloid-like fibrils. 

[CHUNK 2874]
The amyloid-like property of ApoE fragment
is reminiscent of the cross-seeding hypothesis. 

[CHUNK 2875]
Whether the
ApoE fragment initiates Aβ aggregation though cross-seeding
needs further investigation.


[CHUNK 2876]
Aβ-Independent
Mechanisms.


[CHUNK 2877]
ApoE4
also
impairs
synaptogenesis and decreases dendritic spine density. 

[CHUNK 2878]
This
effect is independent of Aβ accumulation (Dumanis et al., 2009;
Brodbeck et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 2879]
Besides, the Aβ-independent roles of
ApoE4 also include its detrimental effects on neuronal plasticity,
aberrant
proteolysis
that
generates
neurotoxic
fragments,
stimulation of Tau phosphorylation and disruption of the
cytoskeleton and impairment of mitochondrial function (Huang,
2010).


[CHUNK 2880]
BIN1
Except for ApoE, some studies sought associations between
biologically plausible candidate genes and risk of sAD. 

[CHUNK 2881]
Among
them, BIN1 gene has been identified as the most important
genetic risk locus in LOAD after ApoE. 

[CHUNK 2882]
Interestingly, although
BIN1 mRNA level was found to be increased in AD brains, the

[CHUNK 2883]
Zhang et al.


[CHUNK 2884]
Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
protein levels of the longest isoform of BIN1 was decreased,
whereas the levels of the shorter BIN1 isoforms were increased
(Chapuis et al., 2013; Holler et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 2885]
BIN1 affects AD risk
through various pathways, mainly including tau pathology, APP
endocytosis/intracellular trafficking, immune/inflammation of
the brain, and calcium transients (Tan et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 2886]
Of those, tau
pathology is the most studied aspect. 

[CHUNK 2887]
BIN1 can interact with tau
(Chapuis et al., 2013), and the decline of BIN1 isoform1 promotes
the propagation of tau pathology (Calafate et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 2888]
BIN1 is
important in the intercellular trafficking of APP, Aβ, ApoE and
BACE1 (Tan et al., 2013; Miyagawa et al., 2016; Ubelmann
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 2889]
Miyagawa et al. 

[CHUNK 2890]
(2016) found that depletion of
BIN1 impaired endosomal trafficking and lysosomal degradation
of BACE1, leading to elevated Aβ production. 

[CHUNK 2891]
Ubelmann et al.


[CHUNK 2892]
(2017) also found that BACE1 was trapped in tubules of early
endosomes and failed to recycle in axons after BIN1 depletion,
eventually resulted in increased Aβ production. 

[CHUNK 2893]
However,
the precise role of BIN1 in the BACE1 recycling remains
speculative.


[CHUNK 2894]
TREM2
TREM2 is a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin
superfamily that is expressed in mononuclear phagocytes,
including microglial in brain (Colonna and Wang, 2016).


[CHUNK 2895]
The main function of TREM2 is regulating the microglial
phagocytosis and response to inflammatory stimulation. 

[CHUNK 2896]
And
the individuals carrying the TREM2 variant R47H have
an increased risk for AD by 2–3 folds (Guerreiro et al.,
2013).


[CHUNK 2897]
TREM2 binds to anionic ligands including phospholipids,
bacterial LPS, sulfatides and DNA (Daws et al., 2003; Cannon
et al., 2012; Wang Y. et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 2898]
Recently, Aβ (Zhao et al., 2018),
clusterin (CLU; Yeh et al., 2016) and ApoE (Atagi et al., 2015)
are also reported to bind the extracellular region of TREM2.


[CHUNK 2899]
The binding with Aβ oligomers mediates Aβ degradation and
downstream signaling (Zhao et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 2900]
Additionally, R47H
variant impairs Aβ binding (Zhao et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 2901]
The binding with
CLU and ApoE also mediate uptake of lipoprotein-Aβ complexes
by microglia. 

[CHUNK 2902]
Uptake of lipoprotein-Aβ complexes was reduced
in individuals carrying a TREM2 AD variant, R62H (Yeh et al.,
2016).


[CHUNK 2903]
TREM2
associated
with
the
adaptor
proteins
DNAX-activation protein 10 (DAP10) and DAP12. 

[CHUNK 2904]
TREM2-
DAP10-DAP12 signaling modulates the energetic cellular
metabolism by activating the mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR; Xing et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 2905]
TREM2-deficient microglia showed
a metabolic defect (Ulland et al., 2017), which may result in the
microglia ineffectively responding to stressful events, such as Aβ
toxicity. 

[CHUNK 2906]
Furthermore, some study crossed the TREM2-deficient
mice with developed Aβ-plaque-driven mice, and they found
microglia of TREM2-deficient mice failed to cluster around Aβ
plaque (Wang Y. et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Yuan et al.,
2016; Mazaheri et al., 2017; Ulland et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 2907]
The clustering
of microglia around Aβ plaque was of significance to limit
the Aβ plaque spreading and protect surrounding neurons
(Condello et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 2908]
The study further found that the lack of TREM2 increased
the Aβ plaque burden in the 5XFAD model of AD (Wang Y.
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 2909]
And the areas not covered by microglia had a high
degree of neural dystrophy (Condello et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 2910]
Instead,
elevated expression of TREM2 reduced neural dystrophy
in the 5XFAD model of AD (Ulland et al., 2017; Lee et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 2911]
However, a TREM2 deficiency in APP/PS1 mice led to
a dramatic reduction in Aβ plaque burden (Jay et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 2912]
The different outcomes may due to the use of different mouse
models.


[CHUNK 2913]
TREM2 also modulates the expression of activation markers
in disease-associated microglia. 

[CHUNK 2914]
TREM2-deficiency failed to
upregulate some activation genes (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 2915]
The partial defect of microglial activation may contribute
to the development of AD. 

[CHUNK 2916]
Recently, TREM2 was found to
alter the degradative process in microglia. 

[CHUNK 2917]
Zhao et al. 

[CHUNK 2918]
(2018)
show that TREM2 KO microglia cause defective clearance of
Aβ by disrupting proteasome function. 

[CHUNK 2919]
Conversely, Lee et al.


[CHUNK 2920]
(2018) reported that lysosomal degradation was involved in Aβ
clearance.


[CHUNK 2921]
Except for the gene mentioned above, there are several genes
related to LOAD, such as PLD3, ABCA7, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP,
CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-
DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B,
SLC24H4 RIN3, SORL1, ZCWPW1 (Karch and Goate, 2015). 

[CHUNK 2922]
But
the relationship with Aβ aggregation is not fully clarified.


[CHUNK 2923]
Age-Related Process
Aging is the primary non-genetic risk for sporadic AD, but
little is known about how aging affects Aβ generation. 

[CHUNK 2924]
Recent
summit addressed seven main hallmarks of the basic aging
process (Kennedy et al., 2014), including decreased adaptation
to stress, loss of proteostasis, stem cell exhaustion, metabolism,
macromolecular damage, unfavorable epigenetic and impaired
inflammaging. 

[CHUNK 2925]
In this review article, we will focus on the
mechanism of age-related pathologic process initiating Aβ
aggregation.


[CHUNK 2926]
Age-Related Neuronal Stress
Several stress-related signaling pathways are related to AD, such
as oxidative stress (Arimon et al., 2015) and nitrosative stress
(Guix et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 2927]
Aging is usually accompanied by accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS; Finkel and Holbrook, 2000). 

[CHUNK 2928]
Generally,
ROS function as messenger and are kept at low level.


[CHUNK 2929]
Excessive amounts of ROS accumulation is defined as oxidative
stress, which will damage various cell components. 

[CHUNK 2930]
In the
brain of AD, ROS production and the level of oxidative
stress
markers
are
elevated
(Krstic
and
Knuesel,
2013).


[CHUNK 2931]
Furthermore, lipid peroxidation precedes Aβ deposition (Pratico
et al., 2001), suggesting the oxidative stress may be an
initiator of Aβ pathology. 

[CHUNK 2932]
Further study found that lipid
peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) elevated γ-
secretase activity and Aβ production, resulting in Aβ and
neurodegenerative pathologies in AD (Gwon et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 2933]
Another study also found the β-secretase activity was affected
by 4-HNE (Arimon et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 2934]
Oxidative stress was also
reported to cause pathogenic PS1 conformational change

Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
(Wahlster et al., 2013) and induce Aβ aggregation (Siegel et al.,
2007). 

[CHUNK 2937]
During the oxidative stress process, superoxide anions
react with nitric oxide generating peroxynitrite, which causes
nitrosative stress. 

[CHUNK 2938]
Peroxynitrite-triggered nitrotyrosination is
especially relevant in AD (Smith et al., 1997). 

[CHUNK 2939]
Guix et al.


[CHUNK 2940]
(2012) found that the secretion of Aβ is enhanced in an
in vitro model of neuronal aging. 

[CHUNK 2941]
This is associated with
an increase in γ-secretase complex formation. 

[CHUNK 2942]
Moreover, the
age-related nitrative stress promoted the nitrotyrosination of
PS1, which is associated with an increased association of the two
PS1 fragments, PS1-CTF and PS1-NTF. 

[CHUNK 2943]
Further, it raised the
Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio.


[CHUNK 2944]
Repressor element 1-silencing transcription (REST) is also
involved in the neuronal stress response. 

[CHUNK 2945]
Lu T. et al.


[CHUNK 2946]
(2014) showed that elevated REST levels are associated with the
preservation of the ordinary aged people from AD. 

[CHUNK 2947]
REST is
induced in the aging human brain and regulates a network of
genes that mediate cell death, stress resistance and AD pathology.


[CHUNK 2948]
At early stages of AD, REST is lost from the nucleus, resulting
in dysregulation of the gene network, including the γ-secretase
complex members PS-2 and pen-2, which are implicated in
Aβ generation. 

[CHUNK 2949]
Interesting, the study also found that aging
individuals who harbor substantial AD pathology do not appear
to progress to dementia when neuronal REST levels are high.


[CHUNK 2950]
Age-Related Inﬂammation
Aging
is
characterized
by
chronic,
systemic,
low-grade
inflammation
(Franceschi
et
al.,
2017).


[CHUNK 2951]
Inflammation
is
considered to contribute to and exacerbate AD pathology
(Gandy and Heppner, 2013; Sudduth et al., 2013; Sarlus and
Heneka, 2017). 

[CHUNK 2952]
The inflammation in AD includes microglia and
astrocytes dysfunction (Xia et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 2953]
One study using viral
mimic to stimulated the systemic immune system found the
deposition of APP and its proteolytic fragments (Krstic et al.,
2012). 

[CHUNK 2954]
Some AD-related chronic disease, such as obesity and
type 2 diabetes, will lead to the systemic inflammatory condition,
which further increases the risk of AD (Takeda et al., 2010;
Thaler et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 2955]
Microglia play the most important role in inflammatory
responses in AD. 

[CHUNK 2956]
In physiological condition, microglia remove
the apoptotic neurons and prune the synaptic connections to
keep the normal development of CNS (Paolicelli et al., 2011;
Hong et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 2957]
In response to neuropathological insults,
including Aβ, microglia alter its morphology and proliferate,
express inflammatory markers, phagocytose dead cells and
myelin debris, secrete cytokines and neurotrophic factors (Lue
et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 2958]
This process is termed as microglial activation.


[CHUNK 2959]
Furthermore, the activation plays a dual role in AD pathogenesis.


[CHUNK 2960]
On the one hand, microglia increase phagocytosis or clearance
of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 2961]
On the other hand, the persistent production of Aβ leads
to the chronic activation of microglia and drive further amyloid
deposition (Hickman et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 2962]
Microglia-Aβ interactions lead
to NACHT-, LRR- and pyrin (PYD)-domain-containing protein
3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation (Heneka et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 2963]
After activation, NLRP3 recruits the adaptor protein apoptosis-
associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC),
triggering ASC helical fibrillar assembly (Lu A. et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 2964]
ASC
rapidly bind to Aβ and increase the formation of amyloid-
β oligomers and aggregates by a cross-seeding mechanism
(Venegas et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 2965]
Under what conditions the microglia
play a positive function, and how can we keep the microglia
inflammatory response in check and promote clearance of Aβ
without accelerating Aβ aggregation remain to be investigated.


[CHUNK 2966]
Astrocytes also participate in neuroinflammation in AD. 

[CHUNK 2967]
Aβ
deposition might be a potent trigger of astroglia activation in AD
because the cells surround Aβ plaques (Medeiros and LaFerla,
2013). 

[CHUNK 2968]
One study found that reducing astrocyte activation in
APP/PS1 mice decreased the amyloid levels and ameliorated
cognitive and synaptic function (Furman et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2969]
The result
suggested that astrocyte activation may play a deleterious role in
AD. 

[CHUNK 2970]
However, it has been confirmed that astrocytes can bind and
degrade Aβ (Wyss-Coray et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 2971]
But in some mouse models
of AD astrocytes show atrophy (Olabarria et al., 2010), which
might result in reduced clearance of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 2972]
Overall, inflammation
plays a complex but important role in AD.


[CHUNK 2973]
Age-Related Disturbances in Proteostasis
Aging is related to a functional decline in protein homeostasis
(proteostasis) machinery, contributing to the development of
protein misfolding in AD. 

[CHUNK 2974]
The proteostasis network (PN)
maintains protein homeostasis by controlling the levels of
functional proteins and preventing their aggregation. 

[CHUNK 2975]
The
process is achieved by three branches of the PN, including
protein synthesis, the chaperone pathways for the remodeling
of misfolded proteins and protein disaggregates, and the protein
degradation pathways (Hipp et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 2976]
mTOR pathway acts
as a central pathway regulating protein synthesis (Saxton and
Sabatini, 2017). 

[CHUNK 2977]
Numerous studies have shown that inhibition of
mTOR activity could extend lifespan among mammalian species,
suggesting mTOR may regulate aging (Antikainen et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 2978]
Activation of mTOR has been recognized as a major event
causing the onset of AD (Yates et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 2979]
The activation
of mTOR downregulates the autophagy, resulting in reduced
clearance of Aβ and elevated Aβ accumulation (Nixon, 2013),
and elevates the expressions of β-secretase and γ-secretase by
AMPK and IGF-1 pathway (Cai et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 2980]
Aβ aggregates are
believed to be detoxified by DAF-16 regulated active aggregation
activity that assembles small oligomers into large, less toxic
structures and HSF-1 mediated disaggregation and degradation
activity (Taylor and Dillin, 2011). 

[CHUNK 2981]
Also, DAF-16 and HSF-1 and
effector molecules such as kinase mTOR can regulate aging.


[CHUNK 2982]
Diabetes
Numerous epidemiological studies suggest that diabetic patients
have a significant risk of developing AD (Arvanitakis et al., 2004;
Luchsinger et al., 2005; Fukazawa et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 2983]
T2DM increases
the risk of dementia by 50%–150% (Strachan et al., 1997; Biessels
et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 2984]
However, the underlying mechanisms with clinical
relevance remain to be elucidated. 

[CHUNK 2985]
Several mechanisms have been
proposed, including insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
resistance, glucose toxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction. 

[CHUNK 2986]
Here we focus on the potential mechanisms by
which diabetes affects the initiation of Aβ aggregation.

Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
Insulin and IGF Resistance
Insulin and IGF signaling is involved in synaptic plasticity,
and the organization and function of the brain, playing
neuromodulatory and neurotrophic roles (Baglietto-Vargas et al.,
2016), and hence may play an essential role in learning
and memory. 

[CHUNK 2990]
Several studies suggest that insulin and IGF
resistance participate in AD pathogenesis (Correia et al., 2011;
Cholerton et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 2991]
AD patients have lower brain levels
of insulin and insulin receptor (IR), and insulin signaling
impairments have been documented in postmortem brain and
animal models of AD (Steen et al., 2005; Lester-Coll et al.,
2006; Moloney et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 2992]
These abnormalities were associated
with increased APP mRNA expression (Steen et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 2993]
A
novel study reveals that insulin deficiency alters APP processing
by increasing the expression of BACE-1 and accompanied by
increased translational upregulation of APP through the PERK-
eIF2α phosphorylation pathway (Devi et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2994]
Another
study found that insulin resistance might alter APP processing
through autophagy activation (Son et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 2995]
Besides, insulin
signaling provides a physiological defense mechanism against
Aβ oligomer-induced synapse loss through downregulating
oligomer binding sites in neurons (De Felice et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 2996]
Insulin also has multiple anti-amyloidogenic effects on human
neuronal cells, including preventing the translocation of the APP
intracellular domain fragment into the nucleus, increasing the
transcription of anti-amyloidogenic proteins, and increasing the
α-secretase-dependent APP-processing pathway (Pandini et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 2997]
On other hand, Aβ oligomers can inhibit insulin signaling
via the JNK/TNFα pathway (Bomfim et al., 2012), suggesting a
positive feed-forward mechanism.


[CHUNK 2998]
Hyperglycemia
Chronic hyperglycemia characterizes diabetes, and several
lines of evidence suggest that hyperglycemia has toxic effects
on the brain (Gispen and Biessels, 2000; Kerti et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 2999]
Epidemiological studies show that hyperglycemia individuals
had a higher risk of AD and exhibited higher conversion rate
from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, indicating
that
hyperglycemia
might
be
responsible
for
AD
onset
and progression (Crane et al., 2013; Morris et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 3000]
Hyperglycemia may have toxic effects on neurons through
several mechanisms, including the direct impact on Aβ, the
formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs; Umegaki,
2014), osmotic insult and oxidative stress.


[CHUNK 3001]
Hyperglycemia directly raises interstitial fluid (ISF) Aβ levels
via altering neuronal activity, which increases Aβ production.


[CHUNK 3002]
KATP channel impairments mediate hyperglycemia-induced
neuronal excitability and increased ISF Aβ (Macauley et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 3003]
Hyperglycemia could also directly inhibit APP protein
degradation and enhance Aβ production (Yang et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 3004]
Moreover, hyperglycemia accelerates Aβ aggregation through the
formation of AGEs. 

[CHUNK 3005]
AGEs are generated by a non-enzymatic
reaction of glucose, free amino groups, lipids, and nucleic acids
(Singh et al., 2001; Sims-Robinson et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3006]
The receptors
for AGEs (RAGE) are highly expressed in both microglia and
neurons and are responsible for the pathological consequences
(Lue et al., 2001). 

[CHUNK 3007]
Aβ is a RAGE ligand, and Aβ-RAGE
interaction exaggerates neuronal stress, accumulation of Aβ,
impaired learning and memory and neuroinflammation (Chen
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 3008]
Additionally, AD patients with diabetes (ADD) have
higher levels of AGEs than non-diabetic AD individuals (Valente
et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3009]
And RAGE is also demonstrated as a cofactor for Aβ-
induced neuronal perturbation in an AD model (Arancio et al.,
2004). 

[CHUNK 3010]
Oxidative stress is also a key player in diabetes and AD
(Moreira, 2012). 

[CHUNK 3011]
Oxidative stress stimulates APP gene expression
and modulates its processing via modulating γ- and β-secretases
(Jolivalt et al., 2010; Oda et al., 2010), which contributes to Aβ
aggregation.


[CHUNK 3012]
Cross-Seeding
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) form β-sheet aggregates in
the pancreas in type 2 diabetes (Pillay and Govender, 2013).


[CHUNK 3013]
Interestingly, IAPP deposits are also found in the brain tissue
of patients with AD (Jackson et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 3014]
IAPP and Aβ share
similar β-sheet secondary structures, and they are 25% identical
in amino acid sequence and have a high binding affinity to each
other (Andreetto et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3015]
Emerging evidence indicates that
cross-amyloid interactions may play a key role in Aβ aggregation,
including the interaction of Aβ-tau (Guo et al., 2006), the
Aβ-α-synuclein (Westermark et al., 1996), and the Aβ-IAPP
interaction (Andreetto et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3016]
The potential mechanisms of
IAPP-induced AD development include the independently toxic
effects, lose the physiological function of soluble IAPP in the
brain, and interacting with Aβ (Zhang and Song, 2017). 

[CHUNK 3017]
In this
part, we will focus on the mechanism of cross-interaction of Aβ
and IAPP.


[CHUNK 3018]
In vitro Evidence
O’Nuallain et al. 

[CHUNK 3019]
(2004) first studied the seeding efficiency
between Aβ(1–40) and amyloid fibrils produced from IAPP.


[CHUNK 3020]
They found the IAPP fibrils are poor seeds for Aβ(1–40)
elongation. 

[CHUNK 3021]
But it is difficult to gauge whether low cross-seeding
efficiency might be biologically significant. 

[CHUNK 3022]
Later, Yang et al.


[CHUNK 3023]
(2013) found both nucleation and fibrillization of Aβ/hIAPP
mixtures (1:1) were slower than pure Aβ or pure hIAPP. 

[CHUNK 3024]
And
they suggest that the cross-seeding of Aβ and hIAPP was less
efficient than homologous seeding of pure Aβ or IAPP. 

[CHUNK 3025]
However,
a study investigating lipid membranes got different results
(Seeliger et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 3026]
They found the aggregation kinetics of
Aβ/IAPP mixtures was slower than that of hIAPP, but faster than
that of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 3027]
Hu et al. 

[CHUNK 3028]
(2015) found the cross-seeding of Aβ/IAPP
led to the retard of peptide aggregation at the nucleation stage
due to structural incompatibility between different amyloid
aggregates, and the acceleration at final fibrillation stage due
to the formation of similar seed structures as templates for
promoting cross-seeding. 

[CHUNK 3029]
Another in vitro study found that the
fibrils of amyloidogenic proteins, including IAPP, functioned
as seeds in the Aβ aggregation, and the seeds accelerate the
Aβ aggregation pathway. 

[CHUNK 3030]
Also, E3, R5, H13, H14 and Q15 of
Aβ are common binding regions between the Aβ monomer
and the fibrillar seeds including IAPP (Ono et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 3031]
Andreetto et al. 

[CHUNK 3032]
(2010) studied the cross- and self-interaction
interface of Aβ and IAPP by using membrane-bound peptide
arrays and fluorescence titration assays. 

[CHUNK 3033]
They identified five

[CHUNK 3034]
Zhang et al.


[CHUNK 3035]
Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
short peptide segments of Aβ and IAPP as hot regions of
the Aβ-IAPP cross-interaction interface, including Aβ(27–32),
Aβ(35–40), Aβ(19–22), IAPP(8–18) and IAPP(22–28), and
these peptides also mediate the self-interaction of Aβ and
IAPP. 

[CHUNK 3036]
They suggested that hetero- and self-association of
Aβ and IAPP most likely occur competitively. 

[CHUNK 3037]
Overall, the
in vitro studies investigated the seeding efficiency and the
interaction regions of hetero- and homo-seeding, though some
results are contradictory. 

[CHUNK 3038]
However, amyloid fibrils in vivo
are functionally different from fibrils grown in vitro. 

[CHUNK 3039]
So,
it is hard to draw biological conclusions from studies only
in vitro.


[CHUNK 3040]
In vivo Evidence
Moreno-Gonzalez et al. 

[CHUNK 3041]
(2017) investigated whether IAPP could
accelerate Aβ aggregation in vitro and in vivo. 

[CHUNK 3042]
They found that
the addition of pre-formed IAPP aggregates to Aβ40 monomers
can accelerate the misfolding of Aβ compared with unseeded Aβ
monomers in vitro, which is consistent with the former studies.


[CHUNK 3043]
Their in vivo study found that the transgenic animals expressing
human IAPP and mutant APP showed increased Aβ burden in
the hippocampus and cortex compared to AD transgenic mice or
AD transgenic animals with type 1 diabetes. 

[CHUNK 3044]
Additionally, IAPP
colocalizes with amyloid plaques in the transgenic mice express
hIAPP and mutant APP. 

[CHUNK 3045]
Furthermore, injection of pancreatic
IAPP aggregates into the APP-mutant mice resulted in more
Aβ burden in the cortex and hippocampus and greater memory
impairments than untreated animals. 

[CHUNK 3046]
Based on these results, the
team provided a hypothesis that IAPP aggregates can accelerate
the transformation process of Aβ by recruiting the normal
soluble protein into the growing aggregates, thereby accelerating
or exacerbating the pathological features of AD.


[CHUNK 3047]
Microbes
The microbiota is a newly discovered human organ that weighs
about 1.5 kg, and contains approximately 90% of the cells of the
human body, with a genetic repertoire that exceeds 100%–200%
of the remaining organisms (Qin et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3048]
The microbes
inhabit different locations, including gut, skin, nose and vagina.


[CHUNK 3049]
The gut harbors the highest concentrations of microbiota so
far and is the best-studied habitat (Scheperjans, 2016). 

[CHUNK 3050]
In
recent years, many studies found the association between gut
microbes disorders and other disorders including diabetes,
obesity, arthritis, allergy, cardiovascular and neurodegeneration
diseases. 

[CHUNK 3051]
The mechanisms through which gut bacteria influence
central process include the neurotransmitters synthesized by gut
bacteria, the activation of immune system, the metabolites, such
as short-chain fatty acids and amyloid (Sherwin et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 3052]
Except for the microbiota, specific microbes including herpes
simplex virus type1 (HSV1), Chlamydia pneumoniae and several
types of spirochaete which were found in the aging human brain
also play a role in the etiology of AD (De Chiara et al., 2012; Balin
and Hudson, 2014; Itzhaki, 2014; Miklossy, 2015). 

[CHUNK 3053]
In this review
article, we will focus on the part of the activation of immune
system in the initiation of Aβ.


[CHUNK 3054]
The microbes of human microbiome can release large
amounts of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which might play a
role in the production of proinflammatory cytokines related
to the pathogenesis of AD (Pistollato et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 3055]
LPSs may
modify gut homeostasis, gut inflammation, and gut permeability
(Hufnagel et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 3056]
Additionally, the presence of bacterial
LPS or endotoxin-mediated inflammation actively contributes
to the potentiated fibrillogenesis of Aβ by stimulating fibril
elongation (Asti and Gioglio, 2014) and attenuated amyloid
clearance by down-regulating TREM2 (Zhao and Lukiw,
2015). 

[CHUNK 3057]
Bacterial amyloid is considered as a pathogen-associated
molecular pattern (PAMP) and induces activation of toll-like
receptor-2 (TLR2) and other inflammatory mediators including
NF-κB, as well as TLR1 and CD14 (Tukel et al., 2010;
Nishimori et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 3058]
Besides, the activated inflammatory
reaction caused by microbiome species, and their secretory
products have shown to intensify the aggregation of amyloids
into senile plaque lesions (Smith et al., 1996; Zhao et al.,
2018).


[CHUNK 3059]
Allen
(2016)
provided
a
novel
hypothesis
about
the
production of Aβ induced by spirochetes. 

[CHUNK 3060]
They found spirochetes
and innate immune system activity in the brains of AD patients.


[CHUNK 3061]
Additionally, they suggested that the innate immune system
first responder TLR2 and its major pathway (MyD88) activates
the secretases which generate Aβ. 

[CHUNK 3062]
Interestingly, Aβ has been
shown to be antimicrobial (Soscia et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3063]
Therefore, they
suggested that Aβ is generated for the purpose to rid the body
of the spirochetal parasites, and the damages of tissue, as well
as the neuronal circuits, are the adverse reactions. 

[CHUNK 3064]
Kumar et al.


[CHUNK 3065]
(2016) gave a more detailed explanation of the antimicrobial
role of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 3066]
They found a rapid seeding and accelerated Aβ
deposition after Salmonella Typhimurium bacteria infections in
5XFAD mice. 

[CHUNK 3067]
And they showed that Aβ fibrils mediated adhesion
inhibition and agglutination activities against Candida. 

[CHUNK 3068]
This
novel perspective deepens our understanding of the enigmatic
role of Aβ in the etiology of AD.


[CHUNK 3069]
Traumatic Brain Injury
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an universal health and
socioeconomic problem. 

[CHUNK 3070]
The risk of AD is increased in
moderate and severe head injury for 2.3 and 4.5 times,
respectively (Plassman et al., 2000). 

[CHUNK 3071]
Besides, a growing number
of epidemiological studies have considered TBI as one of the
most potent risk factors for AD (Molgaard et al., 1990; O’Meara
et al., 1997; Guo et al., 2000; Fleminger et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 3072]
However, two
recent studies found that a history of TBI was not associated with
AD or the Aβ deposition (Crane et al., 2016; Weiner et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 3073]
The conflicting result may due to the difference in severity and
frequency of TBI, which may result in different neuropathologic
outcomes.


[CHUNK 3074]
Numerous studies have shown that TBI can trigger rapid
and insidiously progressive AD-like pathological process, such
as the production and accumulation of Aβ (Johnson et al.,
2010). 

[CHUNK 3075]
Up to 30% of patients who die from TBI have the
Aβ plaques in their brain (Roberts et al., 1991, 1994). 

[CHUNK 3076]
But
the mechanism by which TBI induce Aβ accumulation is still
obscure. 

[CHUNK 3077]
The most common pathologies of TBI is diffuse axonal
injury, which causes an accumulation of proteins in the axon,
including APP (Gentleman et al., 1993; Gorrie et al., 2002).

[CHUNK 3080]
Early Events of Alzheimer’s Disease
Also, PS-1 and BACE1 were found in injured axons after TBI
(Uryu et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 3081]
Furthermore, high APP
production following TBI may increase β-secretase processing
and Aβ genesis (Lou et al., 2017), due to the saturation of
normal α-secretase processing pathway (Gentleman et al., 1993;
Graham et al., 1996). 

[CHUNK 3082]
TBI also induces Aβ genesis via oxidative-
stress-mediated upregulation of BACE1 (Tamagno et al., 2005;
Guglielmotto et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 3083]
TBI is accompanied by hypoperfusion,
vascular dysfunction and ischemia (Ramos-Cejudo et al., 2018),
which may play an important role in Aβ deposition. 

[CHUNK 3084]
It has been
shown that transient hypoxia elevated plasma Aβ42 levels (Gren
et al., 2016); reduced blood flow activated β-secretase and γ-
secretase (Pluta et al., 2013); metabolic acidosis after TBI could
potentially contribute to Aβ accumulation due to the fact that
Aβ is prone to aggregation in a pH-dependent manner (Acharya
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 3085]
S100A9-driven amyloid-neuroinflammatory cascade
may be also involved in the accumulation of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 3086]
S100A9 is
an amyloidogenic protein associated with inflammation, which
was found to form amyloid plaques itself in TBI (Wang et al.,
2018) and AD (Shepherd et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 3087]
Recently, S100A9 was
found abundant in TBI human brain tissue compared to Aβ and
contributed to Aβ plaque formation (Wang et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 3088]
Another
study also found S100A9 also co-aggregated with both Aβ40 and
Aβ42 and promoted their amyloid deposition (Wang et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 3089]
How S100A9 interact with Aβ and whether aggregation
of S100A9 could serve as seeds to accelerate aggregation of Aβ
need a deep investigation.


[CHUNK 3090]
Others
Beside processes mentioned above, many factors may influence
the production and accumulation of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 3091]
For example, dietary fats
may affect cerebrovascular integrity and alter Aβ kinetics across
the blood-brain barrier (Takechi et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 3092]
Sex hormones
also have effects on Aβ pathology (Grimm et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 3093]
Women
exhibit a greater vulnerability to AD (Mielke et al., 2014) and a
more striking Aβ deposition compared to men (Corder et al.,
2004). 

[CHUNK 3094]
Additionally, olfactory impairment subjects have more Aβ
accumulation than normal people (Vassilaki et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 3095]
CONCLUSIONS
A wealth of studies supports the amyloid hypothesis that Aβ
is the initiator of a complex network of pathologic changes in
the brain. 

[CHUNK 3096]
And many earlier events precede Aβ aggregation. 

[CHUNK 3097]
The
best way to eliminate the Aβ pathology is to stop it from taking
hold in the first place. 

[CHUNK 3098]
Although much has been learned, many
important questions remain. 

[CHUNK 3099]
How do the early events initiate
Aβ aggregation? 

[CHUNK 3100]
How can we prevent it? 

[CHUNK 3101]
What is the target
point? 

[CHUNK 3102]
When should measures be taken? 

[CHUNK 3103]
How to explain the
pathogenesis of AD-like dementias without Aβ, and how to avoid
it? 

[CHUNK 3104]
The answers to these questions might bring us to find safe and
effective treatments for AD.

The Role of APOE4 in Disrupting the

APOE4 is the greatest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
increasing the risk of developing the disease by 3-fold in the 14% of the population
that are carriers. 

[CHUNK 4278]
Despite 25 years of research, the exact mechanisms underlying how
APOE4 contributes to AD pathogenesis remain incompletely deﬁned. 

[CHUNK 4279]
APOE in the
brain is primarily expressed by astrocytes and microglia, cell types that are now widely
appreciated to play key roles in the pathogenesis of AD; thus, a picture is emerging
wherein APOE4 disrupts normal glial cell biology, intersecting with changes that occur
during normal aging to ultimately cause neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction.


[CHUNK 4280]
This review article will summarize how APOE4 alters speciﬁc pathways in astrocytes and
microglia in the context of AD and the aging brain. 

[CHUNK 4281]
APOE itself, as a secreted lipoprotein
without enzymatic activity, may prove challenging to directly target therapeutically in
the classical sense. 

[CHUNK 4282]
Therefore, a deeper understanding of the underlying pathways
responsible for APOE4 toxicity is needed so that more tractable pathways and drug
targets can be identiﬁed to reduce APOE4-mediated disease risk.


[CHUNK 4283]
Keywords: APOE, Alzheimer’s disease, astrocytes, microglia, aging
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease of aging, the incidence of which
is expected to increase exponentially as the proportion of the population over the age of 65 increases.


[CHUNK 4284]
Research in AD drug discovery has historically focused on the Amyloid Hypothesis, based primarily
on findings from early-onset AD, which is caused by mutations in amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway proteins
and which accounts for <2% of all AD cases. 

[CHUNK 4285]
While the Amyloid Hypothesis predicts that enhanced
production and diminished clearance of Aβ causes AD, therapeutics aimed at modulating Aβ levels
have largely failed, although they have not yet been tested at presymptomatic stages of disease (Doig
et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 4286]
After aging, the ε4 allele of the APOE gene is the next greatest risk factor for AD, while the
relatively rare ε2 allele confers AD protection (Corder et al., 1993; Saunders et al., 1993; Strittmatter
et al., 1993). 

[CHUNK 4287]
Although 25 years have passed since it was identified, there are still no approved drugs
directly targeting APOE4, due partly to the inherent ‘‘undruggability’’ of lipoproteins. 

[CHUNK 4288]
However, the
atherosclerosis field has demonstrated that indirectly modulating the effect of lipoproteins can be a
successful alternative strategy. 

[CHUNK 4289]
For example, statins affect lipoprotein composition and disease risk
by targeting a metabolic pathway (cholesterol synthesis); similarly, understanding the downstream
pathways that mediate APOE4 disease risk might identify more tractable therapeutic targets for
treating APOE4-mediated AD.

[CHUNK 4292]
APOE4 Disrupts Glial Homeostasis in AD
APOE in the brain is primarily expressed by astrocytes and
microglia, and APOE4 expression alters the normal function
of both of these glial cell types, potentially contributing to
AD risk. 

[CHUNK 4293]
Although the toxicity associated with APOE4 likely
involves the impaired ability of APOE4-expressing glia to
efficiently clear Aβ, it is also apparent that there are Aβ-
independent effects on normal glial physiology. 

[CHUNK 4294]
The role of
APOE in mediating Aβ levels has been discussed in depth
elsewhere (Ries and Sastre, 2016), and will only be briefly
touched upon below. 

[CHUNK 4295]
This review will instead focus on
more recent findings that specifically describe the role of
APOE in glial biology, in addition to and independent of
Aβ modulation, particularly during aging, and will describe
pathways in each glial cell type that may link APOE to disease
pathogenesis.


[CHUNK 4296]
Although
astrocytes
and
microglia
are
the
primary
producers of APOE, whether an interaction between these
cells exists in terms of APOE biology has not been carefully
examined. 

[CHUNK 4297]
Cross-talk between astrocytes and microglia in
neurodegeneration is well-known (Jha et al., 2018); for example,
astrocytes can secrete complement factor C3 in response to
Aβ, which can then activate microglia via the C3a receptor
(Lian et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4298]
On the other hand, lipopolysaccharide-
stimulated microglia can induce neurotoxic ‘‘A1’’ reactive
astrocytes, as opposed to neurotrophic ‘‘A2’’ reactive astrocytes
(Liddelow et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4299]
The same group found that A1-type
astrocytes are present in aging (Clarke et al., 2018) and AD
brain (Liddelow et al., 2017), and that A1 astrocytes not only
lose the neurotrophic capacity of A2 astrocytes, but also actively
produce a neurotoxin to kill neurons and oligodendrocytes.


[CHUNK 4300]
Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that blocking this
microglial-dependent induction of A1 astrocytes is protective
in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease (Yun et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 4301]
Whether blockade of such microglia/astrocyte cross-talk can
help ameliorate neurodegeneration in humans and in AD has yet
to be demonstrated. 

[CHUNK 4302]
Furthermore, whether APOE is one such
secreted factor that mediates interactions between astrocytes and
microglia has not been reported, nor has a synergistic effect of
APOE from each cell type been clearly defined. 

[CHUNK 4303]
Even so, since
both astrocytes and microglia express APOE, this review article
will separately consider specific aspects of each cell type’s normal
physiology that might be impacted by APOE4 expression in
aging and AD.


[CHUNK 4304]
OVERVIEW OF APOE ISOFORMS
APOE is a lipoprotein that normally facilitates lipid transport
between cells (Mahley, 1988). 

[CHUNK 4305]
APOE transcription is activated
by liver X receptor (LXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor γ (PPARγ), transcription factors that regulate lipid
homeostasis and inflammation (Laffitte et al., 2001; Akiyama
et al., 2002; Liang et al., 2004; Mandrekar-Colucci et al.,
2012; Moutinho et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 4306]
In the lipid-rich brain, APOE
is predominantly expressed by astrocytes and microglia, and
perhaps in limited circumstances by neurons (Boyles et al., 1985;
Pitas et al., 1987; Uchihara et al., 1995; Nakai et al., 1996; Xu et al.,
1998, 2006).


[CHUNK 4307]
The human APOE gene exists as three different alleles, ε2, ε3,
and ε4, which are present at ∼7%, 79%, and ∼14%, respectively,
in the entire population (Bertram et al., 2007), and which
exhibit differences in lipid and receptor binding efficiency. 

[CHUNK 4308]
The
presence of one ε4 allele increases the risk of AD by threefold,
while carriers with two ε4 alleles are eight times as likely to
develop AD compared to those without any ε4 allele; and ε4 is
associated with an earlier age of disease onset, from about
85 years without any ε4, to 75 years with one and 68 years
with two ε4 alleles (Corder et al., 1993). 

[CHUNK 4309]
These statistics make
APOE ε4 the greatest known genetic risk factor for AD, more
than any other gene to date. 

[CHUNK 4310]
In contrast to the human gene,
mouse ApoE exists as only one isoform, and the structure of
the mouse APOE protein more closely matches human APOE3
(Raffai et al., 2001); targeted-replacement mice, in which the
endogenous mouse ApoE gene has been replaced with either
of the human APOE isoforms, have therefore been created to
study differences in human APOE isoform function, and will be
referred to throughout this review article (Sullivan et al., 1997;
Knouff et al., 1999).


[CHUNK 4311]
The three human APOE isoforms differ from one another
in the protein sequence at amino acid positions 112 and 158
(Figure 1; Mahley, 1988; Raffai et al., 2001; Hatters et al.,
2006). 

[CHUNK 4312]
These single amino acid differences are enough to change
the lipid and receptor binding ability of APOE (Weisgraber
et al., 1982; Dong and Weisgraber, 1996; Gong et al., 2002).


[CHUNK 4313]
Specifically, R112 in APOE4 creates a domain interaction
between the N-terminal receptor binding domain and the
C-terminal lipid binding domain, preventing efficient binding
to HDL compared to APOE2 and APOE3, with preferential
binding to VLDL (Dong et al., 1994; Dong and Weisgraber,
1996). 

[CHUNK 4314]
While APOE2 is protective against AD, the ε2 allele is also
associated with hyperlipoproteinemia III, which is characterized
by accumulated lipoproteins in the plasma and development of
atherosclerosis (Giau et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 4315]
This is thought to be caused
by impairment in the receptor binding region of APOE2, leading
to delayed lipoprotein clearance and increased triglyceride
and cholesterol levels (Havel and Kane, 1973; Weisgraber
et al., 1982; Mahley and Rall, 2000). 

[CHUNK 4316]
In the context of AD,
APOE2 has been relatively understudied, although some research
is ongoing (Wu and Zhao, 2016). 

[CHUNK 4317]
It should be noted that
APOE2 in many experimental settings is similar to APOE3 or
performs qualitatively better (such as in amyloid clearance).


[CHUNK 4318]
For clarity, and because there is much less in the literature to
explain the mechanism of action of APOE2, the present review
will focus on different phenotypes conferred by APOE3 vs.


[CHUNK 4319]
APOE4.

APOE Isoforms and Amyloid Clearance
Both astrocytes and microglia clear Aβ (Paresce et al., 1996;
Wyss-Coray et al., 2003; Ries and Sastre, 2016) and although
there is some evidence that APOE4 may enhance Aβ production
(Ye et al., 2005), it is widely thought that APOE4 confers AD
risk through deficient Aβ clearance compared to APOE3 and
APOE2 (Koistinaho et al., 2004; Deane et al., 2008; Simonovitch
et al., 2016), although not necessarily via direct binding
(Verghese et al., 2013).

[CHUNK 4327]
Cysteine at position 158 (C158) in APOE2 is thought to cause deﬁcient receptor binding, while
arginine at position 112 (R112) in APOE4 changes the conformation of the entire domain such that R61 is exposed and interacts with C255 in the C-terminal domain
(red dotted line). 

[CHUNK 4328]
This “domain interaction” is thought to be the biophysical basis for differences in APOE4 function compared to the other isoforms; e.g., preference
for VLDL over HDL.

lipid binding ability, but also in affinity for specific APOE
receptors (Ruiz et al., 2005; Holtzman et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 4331]
LRP1,
a major receptor for APOE, mediates Aβ clearance in
astrocytes and pericytes (Liu et al., 2017a; Ma et al., 2018),
and astrocytes expressing APOE4 have reduced LRP1 surface
expression, which could explain impaired amyloid clearance
in vivo (Prasad and Rao, 2018). 

[CHUNK 4332]
However, astrocytes also
utilize other APOE receptors such as LDLR for Aβ clearance,
but in an APOE-independent manner (Basak et al., 2012);
furthermore, Aβ is cleared by transcytosis across the blood
brain barrier, glymphatic and interstitial fluid bulk flow, and
by extracellular degrading enzymes, highlighting the complexity
around understanding how APOE4 contributes to amyloid
accumulation.


[CHUNK 4333]
APOE Isoforms and Tau Pathology
In addition to modulating Aβ, APOE also affects tau pathology,
another hallmark of AD, in an isoform-specific manner.


[CHUNK 4334]
APOE4 worsens tau pathology in the P301S tau mouse
model, and APOE4 genotype is associated with exacerbated
neurodegeneration in human primary tauopathies (Shi et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 4335]
APOE4 status is associated with tau pathology particularly
in instances when amyloid pathology is also present (Farfel
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4336]
The relationship between APOE4 carrier status
and CSF tau levels is more robustly correlated in women
than in men (Hohman et al., 2018), suggesting a possible
sex effect in APOE4-mediated toxicity. 

[CHUNK 4337]
Neurons expressing
P301S tau are less viable when co-cultured with APOE4-
expressing glia compared to APOE2- or APOE3-expressing
glia, while co-culture with APOE−/−glia leads to the greatest
neuronal viability, supporting the idea that APOE4 represents
a toxic gain-of-function (Shi et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4338]
Higher CSF
tau levels are associated with faster disease progression
and reduced cortical plasticity in patients, but only in
APOE4 carriers (Koch et al., 2017), further cementing a role
for APOE4 in exacerbating tau pathology. 

[CHUNK 4339]
Since some evidence
suggests that APOE can be expressed by neurons under stress
(Xu et al., 1998, 2006; Harris et al., 2004), it is possible that
neuron-derived APOE4 directly mediates tau toxicity in neurons,
but the above data suggests that glia-derived APOE4 is likely
contributing as well.


[CHUNK 4340]
Amyloid- and Tau-Independent Effects of
APOE4: Glial Cell Biology
The role of APOE4 in neurological disease is certainly broader
than the clearance or response to misfolded proteins, including
Aβ and tau; for example, APOE receptors play diverse roles
in brain physiology independent of Aβ (Holtzman et al., 2012)
and APOE4 carriers may be susceptible to disorders that do not
involve proteinopathy, such as chemotherapy-induced cognitive
dysfunction (Mandelblatt et al., 2018; Speidell et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 4341]
In addition to the role of APOE4 derived from astrocytes
and microglia, a growing body of literature also supports a
role for APOE4 and pericytes at the blood brain barrier in
neurovascular unit dysfunction and AD pathogenesis (Casey
et al., 2015; Soto et al., 2015; Halliday et al., 2016; Ma et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 4342]
APOE has even been proposed to be proteolytically
cleaved to form either cytotoxic or neuroprotective fragments,
in a cell type- and isoform-specific manner (Brecht et al.,
2004; Muñoz et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4343]
Thus, the neurotoxicity conferred
by APOE4 in AD may not be solely due to its effects on
amyloid or tau pathology, but also to its effects on normal
glial functions. 

[CHUNK 4344]
How these processes fit into the current
understanding of APOE function and neurodegeneration will be
important for drug discovery efforts targeting APOE biology to
treat AD.


[CHUNK 4345]
Astrocytes play critical roles in brain lipid and energy
metabolism, and both microglia and astrocytes have important
immune functions in the brain. 

[CHUNK 4346]
APOE4 expression in each of
these cell types likely disrupts these pathways, ultimately leading
to brain dysfunction in addition to any Aβ- and tau-mediated
effects. 

[CHUNK 4347]
The role of APOE4 and aging in each of these cell types
and pathways will now be examined individually.

APOE4 Disrupts Glial Homeostasis in AD
APOE AND ASTROCYTE BIOENERGETICS
The idea that APOE isoforms differentially mediate astrocyte
bioenergetics has gained increasing support in recent years
and implies that APOE4-expressing astrocytes have deficient
lipid and glucose metabolism, impairing their ability to support
energy-demanding neurons, particularly during aging. 

[CHUNK 4358]
In the
following sections, we will describe different aspects of lipid
homeostasis and glucose metabolism in astrocytes, and how
APOE may be involved in these processes.


[CHUNK 4359]
Astrocytes and Lipid Homeostasis in the
Aging and AD Brain
The most well-studied aspect of APOE biology in AD is lipid
transport, which neurons rely upon for their proper function.


[CHUNK 4360]
Lipid homeostasis is clearly altered in AD: in his first description
of the disease, Alois Alzheimer noted that ‘‘many glial cells
show adipose saccules’’ (Alzheimer et al., 1995), and lipid
accumulations are present in both human AD brain and in an
AD mouse model (Hamilton et al., 2015), as well as in the aging
mouse brain (Shimabukuro et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4361]
Given that the brain is
the most lipid-rich organ outside of adipose tissue (O’Brien and
Sampson, 1965), it is therefore not surprising that lipoproteins,
cholesterol and lipid homeostasis are critical for normal brain
function, including neuronal repair, membrane remodeling,
and plasticity (Mahley, 2016). 

[CHUNK 4362]
For example, disrupting lipid
homeostasis in mice by knocking out both the α and β isoforms
of LXR, which are required for cholesterol and lipid efflux
from astrocytes, leads to widespread abnormalities in the brain,
including an age-dependent accumulation of lipid vacuoles in
perivascular astrocytes (Wang et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 4363]
When SREBP2, a
major positive regulator of cholesterol and lipid synthesis, is
specifically knocked out in astrocytes, mice exhibit reduced brain
weight and deficits in social behavior, learning and memory,
and coordinated movement, as well as elevated glucose oxidation
(Ferris et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4364]
Interestingly, the neurons in these mice
show elevated SREBP2, possibly to compensate for the lack of
SREBP2 in astrocytes; yet this neuron-specific SREBP2 elevation
was not enough to rescue the pathological changes associated
with astrocyte-specific knock-out, underscoring the dependence
of neurons on astrocytic lipids.


[CHUNK 4365]
APOE4 from primary astrocytes is poorly lipidated compared
to APOE3 (Gong et al., 2002); deficient lipid binding and
transport by APOE4 might therefore be expected to result in the
same type of widespread brain abnormalities described above,
ultimately leading to increased risk for AD (Figure 2). 

[CHUNK 4366]
But
despite the poor lipid transport capabilities of APOE4 and the
reliance of neurons on astrocyte-supplied lipid, APOE4 carriers
have generally normal brain function throughout life. 

[CHUNK 4367]
How
then does aging uncover the deficits conferred by APOE4?


[CHUNK 4368]
The young brain may have mechanisms in place to cope
with inefficient APOE4 lipid transport; but aging leads to
decreased cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes (Boisvert et al.,
2018), which, when combined with lower efflux from APOE4,
could tip the balance and culminate in neuronal lipid deficits.


[CHUNK 4369]
Furthermore, Aβ inhibits SREBP2 in primary cultured cells from
FIGURE 2 | Impaired lipid transport capacity of astrocytic APOE4 sensitizes
neurons to degeneration during aging. 

[CHUNK 4370]
Astrocytes (red) expressing
APOE3 supply normal levels of cholesterol and other lipids to the cells of the
brain, particularly to neurons (yellow), maintaining healthy neuronal function
and cognition. 

[CHUNK 4371]
Astrocytes expressing APOE4 are less inefﬁcient at lipid
transport, which, compounded with aging-associated lipid dysregulation,
leads to neurodegeneration (neuron with rough edges) and is expected to
predispose APOE4 carriers to Alzheimer’s disease (AD).


[CHUNK 4372]
mouse cortex (Mohamed et al., 2018), suggesting that amyloid
deposition could make neurons even more dependent on
astrocytic lipids, which would be lacking in ε4 carriers. 

[CHUNK 4373]
Although
cholesterol has been the most extensively studied, changes in
other lipid classes are also observed in serum samples from AD
patients, including sterols, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine,
glycerophosphoethanolamine,
lysophosphatidylcholine,
diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols (Anand et al., 2017);
therefore, APOE4 status could exacerbate other age-related
changes in lipid homeostasis. 

[CHUNK 4374]
While it is unclear whether these
changes in lipid metabolism are a cause or an effect of AD, aging-
and APOE-related perturbations may be expected to exacerbate
amyloid pathology, and vice versa, culminating in widespread
neurodegeneration.

Paradoxical Effects of APOE4 on
Cholesterol Synthesis
Given that APOE4-containing lipoproteins are lipid-deficient,
one might expect lipid secretion to be impaired. 

[CHUNK 4376]
Surprisingly,
human iPSC-derived astrocytes expressing APOE4 reportedly
secrete significantly more cholesterol than their APOE3+
counterparts (Lin et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4377]
Notably, this enhanced cholesterol
secretion was accompanied by higher, not lower, intracellular
cholesterol.

[CHUNK 4380]
APOE4 Disrupts Glial Homeostasis in AD
with the reduced ability of APOE4 to export cholesterol,
which was confirmed in an independent study showing that
APOE4 iPSC-derived astrocytes produce APOE-lipoprotein
particles with less cholesterol than APOE3-expressing cells
(Zhao et al., 2017a). 

[CHUNK 4381]
But the increased cholesterol secretion
is more difficult to explain; how could APOE4 promote
both the intracellular accumulation and enhanced extracellular
secretion of cholesterol in vitro? 

[CHUNK 4382]
One explanation to unite
these seemingly contradictory findings is that these cells are
unable to properly sense that intracellular cholesterol levels
are high. 

[CHUNK 4383]
Normally, negative feedback loops ensure that
cells laden with lipids reduce synthesis and uptake while
increasing efflux—consistent with this signaling mechanism,
SREBP2 was in fact downregulated in APOE4+ iPSC-derived
astrocytes, as would be expected from cells with excessive
lipids (Lin et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4384]
APOE4 might therefore reduce the
clearance of cholesterol via enzymatic oxidation. 

[CHUNK 4385]
Consistent
with this idea, APOE−/−mice have reduced 24-OH-, 7α, and
7β-hydroxycholesterol in their brains (Nunes et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 4386]
Furthermore, APOE mRNA levels are reduced in the APOE4+
iPSCs, and APOE is a major target gene of LXRs, which
are activated by hydroxycholesterol. 

[CHUNK 4387]
In contrast to the above
finding, astrocytes from targeted-replacement mice expressing
APOE4 were previously found to secrete less cholesterol than
astrocytes from APOE3 mice (Gong et al., 2002; Riddell
et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 4388]
While it is possible that species differences in
cholesterol handling between mice and humans could explain
these disparate findings (Dietschy and Turley, 2002), more
research is needed to clarify exactly how APOE genotype affects
astrocyte cholesterol metabolism.


[CHUNK 4389]
APOE4 Disrupts Lipid Droplet Homeostasis
Recent observations indicate that APOE regulates intracellular
lipid storage. 

[CHUNK 4390]
A consequence of SREBP2 inhibition, as might
occur during aging or amyloid deposition, is the reduction of
autophagic lipid mobilization from structures known as lipid
droplets (LDs; Seo et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4391]
LDs are
intracellular accumulations of neutral lipids and are central
to cellular lipid homeostasis, particularly in astrocytes, where
they play a dual role in managing lipids from neurons and
in maintaining astrocytic energy demands. 

[CHUNK 4392]
Elevated reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in neurons induces lipid peroxidation
and triggers subsequent efflux of lipids that accumulate as LDs
in neighboring astrocytes, a process that is neuroprotective
and dependent on APOE (Figure 3; Liu et al., 2015, 2017b).


[CHUNK 4393]
An increase in peroxidated lipids is associated with disrupted
lipid homeostasis, decreased phosphatidylcholine synthesis,
decreased mitochondrial metabolism, and ultimately cognitive
decline (McDougall et al., 2017), and APOE mitigates this
toxicity in neurons by transferring the burden of lipid
accumulation and subsequent clearance to astrocytes. 

[CHUNK 4394]
In a
Drosophila model of neurodegeneration, APOE4 is a complete
loss of function in terms of the neuroprotective formation of
LDs in glial cells, leading to neuronal cell death (Figure 3;
FIGURE 3 | The neuroprotective transfer of toxic lipids from neurons to astrocytes results in lipid droplet formation, which is abrogated in APOE4-expressing cells.


[CHUNK 4395]
Agents or stressors that induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in neurons leads to increased levels of toxic peroxidated lipids. 

[CHUNK 4396]
Neurons transfer these lipids
to astrocytes via APOE. 

[CHUNK 4397]
With APOE3 expression, this transfer results in the formation of lipid droplets (LDs; yellow dots) in astrocytes and neuroprotection.


[CHUNK 4398]
Conversely, APOE4 expression is thought to prevent the transfer of peroxidated lipids to astrocytes, resulting in no LD formation in astrocytes and subsequent
neurodegeneration.

[CHUNK 4401]
APOE4 Disrupts Glial Homeostasis in AD
Liu et al., 2015, 2017b). 

[CHUNK 4402]
These data indicate that APOE
might play an important role not only in astrocyte-mediated
synthesis and transfer of lipids to neurons, but in reverse
as well, as an acceptor of neuronal-derived peroxidated
lipids.


[CHUNK 4403]
Although these studies show that APOE4 expression leads
to a decrease in LD formation when neurons are the lipid
donor and astrocytes are the recipient, APOE4 can also
induce LDs in a cell autonomous manner. 

[CHUNK 4404]
LD formation
results from interactions between the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and mitochondria, at structures known as mitochondria-
associated ER membranes, and APOE may regulate LD
formation by mediating ER-mitochondria communication at
these sites (Tambini et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4405]
Fibroblasts treated with
APOE4 astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) exhibit increased
LDs, and blocking ER-mitochondria tethering returns lipid levels
to normal (Tambini et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4406]
These data indicate that
either the APOE4 ACM contained a factor that signaled to
the cells to induce LDs, or alternatively, that the APOE4 ACM
is somehow nutrient-deprived compared to APOE3 media,
since glucose deprivation also induces LD formation in
astrocytes. 

[CHUNK 4407]
Nutrient deprivation-induced LDs are used for
β-oxidation of fatty acids to generate acetyl-CoA to meet
cellular energy demands (Cabodevilla et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 4408]
Thus,
it is possible that APOE regulation of LDs in astrocytes
is context-dependent: nutrient deprivation induces formation
of LDs and subsequent breakdown by autophagy to fulfill
energy requirements, which APOE4 can stimulate; whereas
increased neuronal oxidative stress leads to accumulation of
toxic lipids, which are transferred to astrocytes, an activity that
is lacking in APOE4 cells. 

[CHUNK 4409]
In either case, APOE4-dependent
deficiency in autophagy would also impair LD breakdown,
causing toxic accumulation in either cell type (Simonovitch
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4410]
Further study delineating the impact APOE4 has
on LD homeostasis could identify points of therapeutic
intervention.


[CHUNK 4411]
Astrocyte Glucose Metabolism in the
Aging Brain
The brain is a highly energy-demanding organ, and declines
in brain glucose utilization and mitochondrial function during
aging may interact with AD risk factors, including APOE, to
negatively impact neuronal homeostasis. 

[CHUNK 4412]
The data supporting
this concept range from model organisms to epidemiology. 

[CHUNK 4413]
For
example, yeast genes that enhance or suppress Aβ toxicity exert
their effect depending on the level of mitochondrial respiration
(Treusch et al., 2011), suggesting that cellular energetics
determines resiliency to amyloid. 

[CHUNK 4414]
Energetics also impacts AD
risk profile in humans: postmenopausal women characterized
as having a poor metabolic profile, which includes elevated
glucose and increased insulin resistance, exhibit worse cognitive
performance compared to healthy metabolic subjects, and
cognitive decline in this group is exacerbated by APOE4 carrier
status (Karim et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 4415]
However, this relationship is likely
complex; a study including both aged women and men found
no difference in glucose levels in AD and APOE4 carriers vs.


[CHUNK 4416]
healthy and non-APOE4 carriers; there were marginal reductions
in insulin and insulin resistance in APOE4 carriers, which
was somewhat increased in individuals with AD (Morris et al.,
2017).


[CHUNK 4417]
To clarify the underlying relationship between APOE4 and
energy homeostasis, APOE4 targeted-replacement mice have
been studied. 

[CHUNK 4418]
Aged (22 months) mice expressing APOE4 exhibit
decreased insulin signaling in cortex and hippocampus (Zhao
et al., 2017b) and middle-aged (6 months) female APOE4 mice
are deficient in the uptake and utilization of glucose in the
brain, with compromised respiratory capacity and decreased
PPARγ signaling (Wu et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4419]
In addition to downregulated
PPARγ, another study found that insulin-degrading enzyme
(IDE) was also downregulated in the hippocampus of the
same aged APOE4 mice (Keeney et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 4420]
Reduction of
PPARγ would be expected to trigger lipid dysregulation by
decreasing lipid synthesis (as described above), as well as dampen
anti-inflammatory signaling; and while lower levels of IDE would
be expected to decrease Aβ clearance, lower IDE should also
increase insulin and affect glucose and glycogen levels, perhaps
leading over time to insulin resistance, although this would
need to be determined experimentally. 

[CHUNK 4421]
In the same study, aged
mice expressing either APOE4 or APOE3 compared to the
neuroprotective APOE2 were also found to have downregulated
insulin signaling proteins IGF1, IRS1, and GLUT4 (Keeney
et al., 2015), in agreement with the idea that aging itself causes
deficient glucose metabolism independently of APOE genotype.


[CHUNK 4422]
As discussed above, energy deficiencies might be exacerbated in
APOE4 carriers as lipid β-oxidation and lipid droplet autophagy
become increasingly important for cell function.


[CHUNK 4423]
Aerobic Glycolysis
Deficits in energy metabolism associated with APOE4 might
also exacerbate aging-associated declines in aerobic glycolysis
(Goyal et al., 2017; Figure 4). 

[CHUNK 4424]
Aerobic glycolysis is the preferential
conversion of glucose to lactate rather than pyruvate, even in
the presence of oxygen, and is typically associated with cancer
cells, although non-cancerous cells also engage in this process
(Jones and Bianchi, 2015). 

[CHUNK 4425]
In fact, astrocytes in mice are capable
of surviving solely by aerobic glycolysis for at least as long as
1 year without any signs of pathology or neurodegeneration
(Supplie et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4426]
Certain brain regions tend to preferentially
use aerobic glycolysis (Vaishnavi et al., 2010), and as the
brain ages, there is a shift towards oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos) to meet energy requirements (Figure 4; Goyal et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 4427]
This aging-related increased reliance on OxPhos has
been proposed to lead to elevated ROS and peroxidated
lipids (Harris et al., 2014), a situation likely made worse in
APOE4 carriers, given the reduced ability of APOE4 to traffic
neuronal peroxidated lipids to astrocytes for elimination. 

[CHUNK 4428]
Thus,
the switch to OxPhos could be an age-dependent trigger for
APOE4 pathophysiology.


[CHUNK 4429]
In line with the concept that aerobic glycolysis is beneficial
or protective, and OxPhos is not, hiPSC-derived astrocytes
from AD patients harboring the PSEN1 ∆E9 mutation are
more oxidative than isogenic controls, with increased ROS
production and decreased lactate secretion (Oksanen et al., 2017).

aging brain. 

[CHUNK 4434]
In the young brain, aerobic glycolysis is generally
favored, resulting in increased lactate production, presumably by astrocytes,
which should be supportive for increased neuronal activity. 

[CHUNK 4435]
With aging, there
is a shift toward oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) instead, resulting in
increased electron transport chain (ETC) activity, increased ROS production,
and more peroxidated lipids. 

[CHUNK 4436]
Healthy cultured cells that are resistant to Aβ
toxicity happen to exhibit a preference for aerobic glycolysis, and aerobic
exercise, which is known to confer neuroprotection, elevates aerobic
glycolysis. 

[CHUNK 4437]
In contrast, cells from familial AD patients (PSEN1∆E9) exhibit
elevated OxPhos. 

[CHUNK 4438]
While young APOE4 carriers may exhibit increased
glycolytic activity, particularly in brain regions associated with AD [e.g., default
mode network (DMN), entorhinal cortex], aged APOE4 carriers may exhibit
elevated OxPhos instead, although more evidence to demonstrate whether
and how such a metabolic shift occurs is warranted.


[CHUNK 4439]
Aβ toxicity exhibit upregulated aerobic glycolysis (Newington
et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 4440]
Furthermore, aerobic exercise, which improves
cognitive scores in aging and AD patients (Panza et al.,
2018), increases aerobic glycolysis and lactate production in
the brain (Matsui et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4441]
Interestingly, in the entorhinal
cortex of APOE4 targeted-replacement mice, genes involved
in OxPhos are upregulated, suggesting an APOE4-dependent
increase in OxPhos and decrease in aerobic glycolysis and lactate
(Figure 4; Nuriel et al., 2017b). 

[CHUNK 4442]
Therapeutic strategies aimed
at improving aerobic glycolysis may therefore help ameliorate
APOE4-mediated toxicity.


[CHUNK 4443]
Glycogen in Astrocytes
Despite its high energy demands, there are few energy stores
in the brain compared to the rest of the body. 

[CHUNK 4444]
In addition
to storing lipids in the form of LDs, astrocytes are also the
primary cell type in the brain to store glycogen. 

[CHUNK 4445]
Astrocytic
glycogen is important for maintaining healthy neurons and
overall brain function, providing an energetic buffer during
periods of low glucose availability (Bak et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4446]
Primary
astrocytes cultured in high (25 mM) vs. 

[CHUNK 4447]
low glucose (5.5 mM)
have elevated rates of glycolysis and glycogen content (Li et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 4448]
Elevated glycogen stores in co-cultured astrocytes are
neuroprotective during glucose deprivation (Swanson and Choi,
1993). 

[CHUNK 4449]
Significant evidence connects glycogen with memory
formation: mice lacking glycogen synthase in the brain have
impairments in learning- and memory-associated synaptic
plasticity (Duran et al., 2013); glycogenolysis is important
for memory consolidation (Gibbs et al., 2006); glycogen is a
precursor to glutamate for learning (Gibbs et al., 2007); and
glycogen content changes with early memory consolidation in
1-day-old chick (Hertz et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 4450]
Activated glycogen synthase
kinase 3 has long been associated with the hallmarks of AD,
including Aβ deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and brain
inflammation, and would furthermore be expected to inhibit
glycogen synthesis and thus decrease glycogen stores (Rayasam
et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 4451]
Energy metabolism in the brain may change during aging in a
cell type-dependent manner. 

[CHUNK 4452]
Inhibition of glycogen breakdown,
termed ‘‘glycogenolysis,’’ disrupts long-term potentiation in
young, but not old, rat hippocampus (Drulis-Fajdasz et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 4453]
In a follow-up proteomics study, the same group found
that, while glycogen phosphorylase (PYGB), the rate-limiting
enzyme in glycogen degradation, is predominantly expressed in
astrocytes in young animals, its distribution switches to being
present in both neurons and astrocytes in old animals (Drulis-
Fajdasz et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4454]
As glycogen accumulation in neurons
normally triggers apoptosis (Vilchez et al., 2007; Duran et al.,
2012), the authors speculate that upregulation of PYGB in
neurons may be a protective mechanism to keep neuronal
glycogen stores low. 

[CHUNK 4455]
However, total depletion of glycogen in
neurons may not be desirable in all circumstances, as low levels of
neuronal glycogen may be protective during hypoxia (Saez et al.,
2014).


[CHUNK 4456]
The importance of glycogen to enhanced memory is not
necessarily ascribed to elevated pyruvate for mitochondrial
OxPhos, since aged wild-type and adult APP/PS1 mice fed a
diet supplemented with pyruvate still exhibit impairments in a
passive avoidance task for fear memory, despite a preservation
of glycogen stores and enhanced exploratory behavior (Koivisto
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4457]
Rather than supplying pyruvate for OxPhos,
glycogen may instead supply lactate to mediate its beneficial
effects, as described in the following section.


[CHUNK 4458]
Lactate, Glycogen and the
Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle
Hypothesis
The Astrocyte-Neuron Lactate Shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis was
first formulated in 1994 (Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994, 2012),
and describes a process in which astrocytes metabolize glucose
to export lactate for neurons during periods of high neuronal
activity, during learning and memory, for example. 

[CHUNK 4459]
The existence
of an astrocyte-to-neuron transport of lactate would necessitate
a lower basal concentration of lactate in neurons compared to
astrocytes, and a recent study has indeed demonstrated such
a gradient in vivo, using a genetically-encoded lactate sensor
(Machler et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 4460]
Despite findings in support of the ANLS hypothesis, there
has been some disagreement in the field as to whether astrocytic
lactate is really used by active neurons in the brain, if neurons
are able to produce their own alternative energy substrates, or
if astrocytes produce lactate in response to their own energetic
demands (Dienel, 2012). 

[CHUNK 4461]
For example, computer simulations
of neuron/astrocyte energetics, based on fMRS data, support a
model in which neurons readily metabolize glucose and export
lactate, which is taken up by astrocytes, and not the other way
around (Simpson et al., 2007; Mangia et al., 2009).

APOE4 Disrupts Glial Homeostasis in AD
Although neurons are certainly capable of taking up glucose
and secreting lactate themselves, there is compelling evidence
that lactate secretion from astrocytes, derived from glycogen
stores specifically, is important in contexts of neuronal high
energy demand. 

[CHUNK 4472]
For example, the transport of lactate specifically
from astrocytes to neurons is necessary for long-term memory
formation (Suzuki et al., 2011) and spatial working memory
(Newman et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 4473]
Neuronal activity can upregulate
astrocytic genes involved in lactate production and export
(Hasel et al., 2017), ensuring that astrocytes are able to supply
neurons with the necessary lactate during periods of intense
energetic demands. 

[CHUNK 4474]
Lactate derived from astrocytic glycogen
can sustain neuronal activity in the absence of other forms
of energy, and blocking the transfer of lactate from astrocytes
to neurons in the absence of any other energy source leads
to axonal/neuronal failure (Ransom and Fern, 1997; Wender
et al., 2000; Brown et al., 2003, 2005; Suh et al., 2007; Walls
et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 4475]
Blocking glycogen degradation or lactate transfer
reduces glutamate release from neurons (Sickmann et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 4476]
Furthermore, exhaustive exercise decreases brain glycogen and
elevates astrocyte-derived lactate (Matsui et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4477]
While the
original ANLS hypothesis may undergo revision and refinement,
astrocytic glycogen-derived lactate certainly appears to be an
important component of healthy neuronal function, particularly
during times of nutrient deficiency.

Connecting APOE4 and Brain Energy
Metabolism: Future Directions
How
could
aging

interface
with
APOE4 genotype to exacerbate neurodegeneration? 

[CHUNK 4479]
Young
adult APOE4 carriers have altered expression of proteins
involved in glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate
cortex (PCC), a central component of the DMN (Perkins et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 4480]
Subregions of the PCC are proposed to be involved in
internally directed cognition, including memory retrieval and
planning, as well as controlling attentional focus (Leech and
Sharp, 2014). 

[CHUNK 4481]
The DMN is highly metabolically active and is
one of the earliest regions to deteriorate in AD and in normal
aging (Leech and Sharp, 2014), and young APOE4 carriers
exhibit increased activity in the DMN before any signs of
disease (Filippini et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 4482]
In agreement with this increased
activity, hiPSC-derived neurons from APOE4 patients are
hyperactive (Lin et al., 2018), and APOE4 targeted-replacement
mice exhibit a hyperactive entorhinal cortex compared to
APOE3-expressing mice (Nuriel et al., 2017a). 

[CHUNK 4483]
While young
APOE4 carriers were found to express higher levels of
glycolysis enzymes (GLUT1, GLUT3, HEX1, MCT2, SCOT,
AACS) and complexes I, II, and IV of the electron transport
chain (ETC), there were lower levels of MCT4, an important
transporter for astrocytic lactate secretion (Perkins et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 4484]
Disruption of MCT4 impairs long-term memory, which is
rescued by lactate injection, while memory impairment caused
by disruption of the neuronal lactate transporter MCT2, is
not rescued by lactate, strongly supporting the notion that
astrocytic export of lactate is critical for long-term memory
formation (Suzuki et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 4485]
Thus, the decreased MCT4 in
young APOE4 carriers might be expected to cause a deficit
in lactate secretion by astrocytes, despite higher glycolytic
activity. 

[CHUNK 4486]
Interestingly, the DMN is a region that relies on
aerobic glycolysis in young, healthy brain (Vaishnavi et al.,
2010), and so should be a region that relies on elevated
lactate production to support neuronal activity; the increased
neuronal activity and decreased capacity of astrocytes to
keep up with such activity in APOE4 carriers might then
be expected to burn out glycogen stores early, effectively
accelerating an aging-associated metabolic phenotype reliant on
OxPhos. 

[CHUNK 4487]
Further work is necessary to determine whether this
pathway could be induced by diet, exercise, or pharmacological
intervention to preserve cognitive function in presymptomatic
APOE4 carriers.


[CHUNK 4488]
In summary, APOE performs a complex set of interrelated
functions in astrocytes, ranging from its long-appreciated lipid
transport function to regulation of lipid storage and utilization
to cellular energetics. 

[CHUNK 4489]
In the next section we will review emerging
concepts around APOE function in the other major producer of
APOE in the brain, microglia.


[CHUNK 4490]
MICROGLIA-DERIVED APOE IN AGING
AND AD
A large body of evidence implicates microglia in APOE-mediated
AD pathogenesis, particularly in relation to aging. 

[CHUNK 4491]
Microglial
APOE production is strongly induced during injury and disease,
including in AD (Olah et al., 2018; Ping et al., 2018; Rangaraju
et al., 2018a). 

[CHUNK 4492]
In 5XFAD transgenic mice, which harbor five
different human familial AD-causing mutations and exhibit
accelerated amyloid pathology (Oakley et al., 2006), microglial
APOE mRNA is significantly increased (Wang et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 4493]
A
similar increase in microglial APOE mRNA was also found in
a separate but similar transgenic mouse model of accelerated
amyloid pathology, APP/PS1 (Orre et al., 2014), as well as in aged
(isolated from 24 month old mice) vs. 

[CHUNK 4494]
younger (5 month old)
mouse microglia (Hickman et al., 2013), and in the Ercc1 mutant
mouse model of accelerated aging (Raj et al., 2014a; Holtman
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 4495]
The upregulation of APOE mRNA in these mouse
models of AD and aging reflect concordant increases at the
protein level and in human AD brain. 

[CHUNK 4496]
A recent proteomics
study of microglia isolated from 5XFAD mice identified APOE
as one of the top upregulated proteins (Rangaraju et al., 2018a).


[CHUNK 4497]
Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis in this same study
indicated that the microglia with elevated APOE were those
surrounding amyloid plaques, demonstrating that a distinct
subset of microglia increase APOE expression, rather than all
microglia. 

[CHUNK 4498]
Furthermore, the aged mouse microglial proteome
also shows an enrichment in APOE protein compared to
non-aged mice (Rangaraju et al., 2018a). 

[CHUNK 4499]
In agreement with these
findings in mice, an analysis of frontal cortex human postmortem
brain tissue found elevated APOE protein in AD patients vs.


[CHUNK 4500]
healthy controls (Ping et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4501]
Another study performing a
post-mortem human brain proteomics analysis also found APOE
to be higher in the aged microglia (Olah et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4502]
Thus aging
alone, and not only disease pathogenesis, is sufficient to induce
microglial APOE expression at both the mRNA and protein
level.

[CHUNK 4506]
Microglia expressing APOE4 vs. 

[CHUNK 4507]
APOE3 tend to exhibit a disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like phenotype; this includes increased pro-inﬂammatory cytokine
production with impaired phagocytic ability, deﬁcient clearance of debris (including amyloid plaques), and impaired migratory ability. 

[CHUNK 4508]
These changes, compounded
with the pro-inﬂammatory phenotype associated with normal aging, result in an increased risk of developing AD.


[CHUNK 4509]
The expression of APOE in subsets of disease- and aging-
associated microglia raises an important question: what role does
APOE play in the microglial response to disease and aging, and
how is this impacted by APOE4 genotype? 

[CHUNK 4510]
Both mouse and
human studies indicate that key microglial functions are affected
by APOE genotype, including transcriptomic changes towards
the disease-associated phenotype, the percent of microglia
coverage around plaques, increased cytokine production, as well
as chemotaxis, phagocytosis and, perhaps, synaptic pruning
(Figure 5). 

[CHUNK 4511]
Each of these functions are discussed in the following
sections.


[CHUNK 4512]
APOE and the Microglial Phenotype in AD
The transcriptional profile of microglia is altered in AD,
switching from a homeostatic phenotype to a molecular profile
often referred to as the disease-associated microglial (DAM)
phenotype (Zhang et al., 2013; Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Sarlus
and Heneka, 2017; Rangaraju et al., 2018b). 

[CHUNK 4513]
Genome-wide
association studies (GWAS), including large-scale meta-analyses,
have indicated that the majority of genetic variants conferring
risk for late onset sporadic AD are immune-related and enriched
in microglia, implicating DAM microglia in AD pathogenesis
(Guerreiro et al., 2013; Lambert et al., 2013; Dos Santos
et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4514]
The affected genes include
myeloid receptors TREM2 and CD33, transcriptional regulators
SPI1 (Pu.1) and MEF2C, complement pathway (CR1), antigen
presentation (HLA-DRB5), the MS4A family locus, and ABCA7,
amongst several others (Lambert et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 4515]
Some single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present in non-coding
regions and alter expression of microglial genes (e.g., SPI1;
CD33), whereas other SNPs result in a gain or loss of function
in several microglial genes related to immune function (e.g.,
TREM2) (Raj et al., 2014b; Malik et al., 2015; Huang et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 4516]
A large-scale weighted gene coexpression network analysis
(WGCNA) combined with pathological assessment of 1647
post-mortem brain tissues from late-onset AD patients and
non-demented controls pointed to immune/microglial gene
networks as having the most significant functional enrichment of
all modules (Rangaraju et al., 2018b). 

[CHUNK 4517]
Moreover, this microglial
module was significantly associated with the greatest number
of AD-relevant pathological traits, including the extent of
brain atrophy, and represented immune pathways consisting
of complement, Fc-receptors, major histocompatibility complex
(MHC), cytokines/chemokines and toll-like receptors (Zhang
et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 4518]
Since then, several groups have characterized
this DAM phenotype/immune network, albeit with varying
nomenclature (Gjoneska et al., 2015; Keren-Shaul et al., 2017;
Rangaraju et al., 2018b), and attempts to identify key regulators
of this transcriptomic phenotype have been underway (Gjoneska
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 4519]
A common theme on which these genetic risk
factors converge is that they alter key microglia activities,
including phagocytosis, cytokine production, and microglial
encapsulation of amyloid plaques (Figure 5). 

[CHUNK 4520]
Altogether, this
work has repositioned the thinking in the field, emphasizing
microglia as a potential source of attractive therapeutic targets
for AD.


[CHUNK 4521]
Interestingly, APOE is a key regulator of the microglial
transcriptional signature, as demonstrated in post-mortem
human brain studies, human cellular models as well as in AD
mouse models and cultured microglia in vitro (Keren-Shaul
et al., 2017; Krasemann et al., 2017; Pimenova et al., 2017; Lin
et al., 2018; Olah et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4522]
Studies performing single cell
RNA sequencing of CD45+ microglia from 5XFAD mice, paired
with in situ hybridization of DAM signature genes, indicate
that both the morphology and molecular identity of microglia
around plaques, as a population, are different from microglia
distal to plaques (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4523]
These DAMs
have increased APOE expression that is triggered following
a downregulation in homeostatic genes such as CX3CR1 and
P2Y12 (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Krasemann et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 4524]
Furthermore, APOE mediates the switch from homeostatic to
the DAM phenotype; notably, knocking out APOE specifically
in microglia in 5XFAD mice prevents the transition to the
DAM phenotype and partially rescues neuronal cell death in
an axotomized facial motor nucleus model (Krasemann et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 4525]
A full knockout of APOE conferred no additional
protection over that of microglia-selective APOE deletion,
highlighting the importance of microglia-specific APOE to
this process (as opposed to astrocytic APOE, for example;
Krasemann et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4526]
However, an astrocyte-selective APOE
model was not directly compared, so it remains possible
that it is not the cellular source of APOE that matters, but

Notably, this APOE4 gene expression
signature significantly overlapped with the transcriptional
profile seen in human brain (Lin et al., 2018), in support
of the notion that APOE4 may impact the DAM phenotype
in
human
AD.


[CHUNK 4535]
A
WGCNA
transcriptomic
analysis
of
brain from APOE3 or APOE4 targeted-replacement mice
subjected to traumatic brain injury identified that the network
most significantly associated with APOE genotype was the
‘‘innate
immune
response,’’
which
included
complement
activation; in this network, the genes were shifted toward
increased expression along with APOE4 compared to APOE3
(Castranio et al., 2017), again supporting a model in which
APOE4 confers a pro-inflammatory phenotype relative to
APOE3.


[CHUNK 4536]
APOE Regulation of Microglial Plaque
Association
APOE immunoreactivity in human brain is enriched in
congophilic, dense-core plaques (Navarro et al., 2003), as
opposed to diffuse plaques, which are heterogeneous with respect
to APOE immunoreactivity (Gearing et al., 1995). 

[CHUNK 4537]
Notably,
microglial activation around diffuse plaques is minimal (Maat-
Schieman et al., 1994; Stalder et al., 1999; Mrak, 2012), begging
the question as to whether the presence of APOE in plaques
is the trigger that differentially activates microglia at specific
plaque types, or whether the presence of APOE in the plaques
is simply due to the upregulation of APOE upon transition from
homeostatic microglia to DAMs (Ulrich et al., 2014; Krasemann
et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 4538]
APOE4-expressing immune cells are less efficient at plaque
engulfment compared to APOE3-expressing cells. 

[CHUNK 4539]
When GFP+
bone marrow cells from human APOE3 or APOE4 donor
mice were transplanted into lethally-irradiated 5 month old
APPswe/PS1∆E9 [i.e., bone marrow transplanted (BMT)-
APP/PS1] mice, donor GFP+ macrophages are found in
the brain 8 months later, with APOE3 exhibiting greater
numbers of plaque-associated GFP+ Iba1+ cells (Yang et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 4540]
Interestingly, APOE4 was associated with reduced
microglia coverage around Aβ plaques (Yang et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 4541]
Proper
microglial
encapsulation
of
plaques
is
thought
to be protective, sequestering damage from surrounding
cells,
and
decreased
microglial
coverage
is
associated
with higher Aβ levels and increased neuronal dystrophy
(Yeh et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4542]
Indeed, the percentage of Aβ per area
was significantly higher in the hippocampus and cortex of
mice with APOE4 vs. 

[CHUNK 4543]
APOE3 transplant (Yang et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 4544]
Furthermore, APOE4 BMT-APP/PS1 mice had significantly
higher brain expression levels of the pro-inflammatory genes
TNFα and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF;
which are upregulated in AD patients), lower levels of the
anti-inflammatory gene IL-10, and impaired spatial working
memory in the Barnes maze, compared with APOE3 BMT-
APP/PS1 mice (Yang et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 4545]
In another study using 5XFAD mice crossed to APOE3 or
APOE4
targeted-replacement
mice,
mice
expressing
APOE4 exhibited significantly larger and more numerous
amyloid plaques, as well as increased microglial dystrophy;
but in contrast to the Yang et al. 

[CHUNK 4546]
(2013) study, more microglia
were found surrounding plaques in APOE4 vs. 

[CHUNK 4547]
APOE3 and
APOE2 (Rodriguez et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 4548]
It is difficult to distinguish
whether the change in microglia phenotype in relation to
plaque type is indirect, in response to worsened pathology
or if it is also partly due to a cell autonomous effect of
APOE4 on microglia, irrespective of plaque type. 

[CHUNK 4549]
While these
in vivo studies are informative, other recent studies indicate
cell-intrinsic APOE4 effects on microglia. 

[CHUNK 4550]
More specifically,
human iPSC-derived microglia from APOE4 carriers have
different morphology compared to isogenic APOE3 controls,
and have a reduced capacity to phagocytose Aβ (Lin et al., 2018),
in agreement with a change towards the DAM phenotype. 

[CHUNK 4551]
Thus,
APOE4 expression impairs the ability of microglia to efficiently
clear amyloid pathology, although the precise mechanisms
underlying microglial recruitment to specific amyloid plaques
require further characterization.


[CHUNK 4552]
APOE Genotype and Cytokine Production
An overwhelming body of evidence supports that the presence
of APOE4, either recombinantly applied or endogenously
expressed, confers an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine
production across rodent and human species, in blood,
brain, and microglia. 

[CHUNK 4553]
In support, rat primary glial cultures
comprised of astrocytes and microglia produce higher levels
of IL-1β when exposed to recombinant APOE4, purified
from APOE-expressing HEK293 cell culture medium, than
APOE3 (Guo et al., 2004). 

[CHUNK 4554]
Cultured mouse microglia derived
from APOE4 targeted-replacement mice have an activated
morphology,
produce
higher
levels
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines including TNFα, IL-6, and IL12p40, and nitric oxide
(NO) along with lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines
than their APOE3-derived counterpart when exposed to
various pro-inflammatory mediators including LPS, IFNγ,
or LPS+ IFNγ (Brown et al., 2002; Colton et al., 2005;
Vitek et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 4555]
Notably, some of these effects (e.g., NO
production) are APOE4 gene dosage-dependent (Vitek et al.,
2009).


[CHUNK 4556]
Similar to that seen in cultured microglia, APOE4 mice
immune-challenged with a peripheral injection of LPS exhibit
higher brain mRNA expression levels of TNFα and IL12p40 than
in that from APOE3 TR mice (Vitek et al., 2009).

[CHUNK 4559]
APOE4 Disrupts Glial Homeostasis in AD
similar increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely TNFα
and IL-6, in APOE4 mouse serum is seen following a
peripheral injection with LPS compared to that in APOE3 mice
(Lynch et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 4560]
Finally, when LPS is administered by
intracerebroventricular injection, APOE4 mice have higher brain
levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα than APOE3 mice (Zhu et al.,
2012).


[CHUNK 4561]
While this increase has been consistently observed by
independent groups in vivo in APOE targeted-replacement
mice in AD models (Tai et al., 2011), due to perhaps
independent roles of APOE genotype on other aspects of
the disease (e.g., Aβ plaque levels), it is not clear whether
the increase in cytokines by APOE4 is due to the increase
in pathology, or due to a direct effect of APOE4 on
cytokine production, which could contribute to the increase
in pathological changes. 

[CHUNK 4562]
Cell culture experiments shed some
light on the former, in that the effect of APOE4 seems to be
a cell-autonomous effect on microglia as when stimulated in
culture, they produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as IL-1β (Guo et al., 2004), which suggests the differential
extent of pathology (e.g., amyloid plaque deposition) as not
being the sole driver of the differential increase in cytokines
due to APOE4 vs. 

[CHUNK 4563]
APOE3 genotype. 

[CHUNK 4564]
Since these APOE
targeted-replacement mouse studies assess the effect of human
APOE in a mouse context, it remains plausible that this
toxic pro-inflammatory effect attributed to APOE4 could be
specific to mouse; however, human data indicates otherwise
and suggests this phenomenon is intrinsic to the human APOE
isoform irrespective of species by which it is produced/acting
upon. 

[CHUNK 4565]
Indeed, over the past few years, studies using advanced
human cellular models parallel the pro-inflammatory findings
seen in mice (Lin et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4566]
Further, human clinical
data suggests something similar. 

[CHUNK 4567]
In two Chinese populations
with AD, APOE4 carriers, carrying either one or two copies,
had elevated plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β compared to that of APOE2 and
APOE3 carriers (Fan et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4568]
Also, APOE genotype
modulates cytokine production in human peripheral blood when
stimulated with pro-inflammatory mediators ex vivo as well as
in vivo. 

[CHUNK 4569]
More specifically, ex vivo stimulation of peripheral
blood collected from healthy volunteers with TLR2 and
TLR4 ligands demonstrated that TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17,
IFNγ, G-CSF, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1a, and IP-10 levels were
robustly increased in that from APOE3/E4 compared to
APOE3/E3 carriers (Gale et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 4570]
Similarly, healthy
human subjects intravenously administered the TLR4 ligand
LPS exhibited higher plasma TNFα levels in APOE3/E4 vs.


[CHUNK 4571]
E3/E3 (Gale et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 4572]
In recent years, more advanced
human cellular models make the picture clearer and indicate the
mouse findings are not species specific and extend to human
microglia.


[CHUNK 4573]
Are these effects good or bad? 

[CHUNK 4574]
Notably, recent studies have
been controversial as to whether the best therapeutic approach
for AD with respect to targeting APOE would be to lower
APOE levels or augment them. 

[CHUNK 4575]
As in astrocytes, the effects
of APOE4 in microglia are often confounded by reports that
APOE4 production and/or protein stability is lower compared
to APOE3 (Bertrand et al., 1995; Raffai et al., 2001; Glockner
et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 4576]
Thus, it remains plausible that this inflammatory
response could be due to a decrease in APOE levels, irrespective
of genotype. 

[CHUNK 4577]
APOE3 can dampen cytokine production, and
removing
APOE
can
lead
to
a
more
pro-inflammatory
phenotype. 

[CHUNK 4578]
So, would elevating APOE4 protein levels help
ameliorate the pro-inflammatory phenotype, or worsen it?


[CHUNK 4579]
Microglial APOE is neuroprotective in rat microglia neuronal
co-cultures (Polazzi et al., 2015) and this release of APOE
and the resulting neuroprotective effect is lost when microglia
are exposed to inflammatory stimuli, thus lowering APOE.


[CHUNK 4580]
Therefore, it is interesting to hypothesize that, in the context of
AD, when microglia are exposed to pro-inflammatory stimuli,
APOE synthesis and secretion is stunted (Saura et al., 2003;
Polazzi et al., 2015), effectively decreasing any neuroprotective
effects of the microglia. 

[CHUNK 4581]
A study examining the effect of
APOE genotype comparing WT neurons cultured with either
APOE3 vs. 

[CHUNK 4582]
APOE4 mouse-derived astrocytes or microglia
found that only APOE4 microglia led to greater neurotoxicity
(Maezawa et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 4583]
Interestingly, the greater toxicity of
APOE4 correlated with higher pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
(TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β). 

[CHUNK 4584]
Finally, it should be noted that the
APOE4 effects can be sex-specific in certain contexts (Colton
et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 4585]
APOE Effect on Phagocytosis, Synaptic
Pruning, and Chemotaxis
While the effect of APOE genotype on synaptic pruning and
phagocytosis has been not been studied in microglia, astrocytic
phagocytosis has been evaluated using APOE2, APOE3, and
APOE4 targeted-replacement mice crossed to mice expressing
EGFP driven by the astrocyte-specific promoter Aldh1l1 (Chung
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 4586]
Fluorophore-conjugated cholera toxin-β subunit
(CTB-594) was used to label axonal projections of retinal
ganglion cells and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, an area
with a high degree of synaptic pruning during development. 

[CHUNK 4587]
In
agreement with in vitro phagocytic assessments, astrocytes in
APOE2 mice showed significantly enhanced phagocytic capacity
compared with APOE3, whereas astrocytes in APOE4 mice
demonstrated a significant decrease (Chung et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 4588]
Although this study focused on astrocytes, microglia are key
players in synaptic pruning (Paolicelli et al., 2011; Schafer
et al., 2012); thus, it would be informative to determine
whether the effect of APOE genotype on synaptic pruning
is cell type-specific or not. 

[CHUNK 4589]
In vitro, ApoE−/−mouse-derived
peritoneal macrophages demonstrated a decreased uptake of
apoptotic cells, but no change in ability to uptake latex
beads, compared to WT (Grainger et al., 2004). 

[CHUNK 4590]
Given that
APOE4 from human CSF was found to form smaller complexes
than APOE2 and APOE3, it has been proposed that APOE4 may
be deficient in lipid debris clearance, in accordance with
phagocytic studies conducted on APOE4 human iPSC-derived
microglia (Lin et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 4591]

APOE and Other Microglial AD Risk
Factors
Several studies have looked at potential interactions between
APOE and TREM2, another genetic risk factor for AD (Guerreiro
et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 4596]
APOE can bind TREM2 (Atagi et al., 2015; Yeh
et al., 2016), and, either directly or indirectly, APOE can alter
TREM2 signaling or function (Jendresen et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4597]
Both APOE
and TREM2 are implicated in key steps in the homeostatic to
DAM phenotype (Krasemann et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 4598]
It is still unclear
whether there is and to what extent there is an interaction
in APOE and TREM2, genetically or functionally, warranting
further investigation.


[CHUNK 4599]
Other risk factors for AD have clear functional overlap
with APOE. 

[CHUNK 4600]
Of note, ABCA7, also expressed in microglia, has
been associated with age of onset of AD in a similar manner
as APOE. 

[CHUNK 4601]
More specifically, the minor allele at rs3764650 in
ABCA7 is associated with a delayed onset and shorter disease
duration (Kim et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 4602]
While its function in regulating the
homeostasis of phospholipids and cholesterol has been the most
well studied function of ABCA7 in relation to APOE, it also plays
a role in phagocytosis (Tomioka et al., 2017), which has been
observed in vitro and in vivo and been reviewed more extensively
elsewhere (Abe-Dohmae and Yokoyama, 2012; Aikawa et al.,
2018).


[CHUNK 4603]
Future Directions for Understanding
Microglial APOE in Immunosenescence
Is microglial APOE upregulation in aging and AD helpful
or harmful? 

[CHUNK 4604]
Is it a compensatory mechanism, or does it
contribute to accelerated aging and neurodegenerative disease
pathogenesis? 

[CHUNK 4605]
It is interesting to speculate that the two greatest
risk factors for late-onset AD, aging and APOE, interact
with respect to inflammation, with APOE4 promoting an
enhanced inflammatory tone over the course of a lifetime
(Olarte et al., 2006; Sando et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 4606]
Microglia undergo
senescence with aging, a process termed immunosenescence
(Costantini et al., 2018), consistent with a DAM phenotype,
and accumulating evidence suggests that APOE4 genotype
may aggravate this process to promote neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration in AD. 

[CHUNK 4607]
The change in cellular source of
APOE from predominantly astrocyte-derived, to astrocyte- and
microglia-derived during disease or aging, raises questions as
to whether the cellular source of APOE subserves differential
functions. 

[CHUNK 4608]
It should be noted however, that although APOE
immunoreactivity has been demonstrated around plaques in
post-mortem human AD brain, co-labeling of APOE with
microglial markers has not been investigated. 

[CHUNK 4609]
Thus, a careful
evaluation of this is warranted given the recent advances in
understanding APOE expression in AD models. 

[CHUNK 4610]
Finally, although
there are clearly centrally mediated and cell-autonomous effects
of APOE4, several peripheral effects of APOE4 on immune cells
have been observed, and as such, it is unclear as to what extent the
peripheral component of APOE4 status has on the risk to AD.


[CHUNK 4611]
FIGURE 6 | APOE4 disrupts homeostatic pathways in astrocytes and
microglia to cause neurodegeneration and AD. 

[CHUNK 4612]
APOE4 expression and the
normal aging process itself impair astrocyte and microglia physiology in
speciﬁc pathways, which could theoretically be targeted to treat AD. 

[CHUNK 4613]
In
addition to deﬁcient clearance of Aβ, emerging evidence speciﬁcally highlights
lipid dysregulation and deﬁcient glucose metabolism in astrocytes, and a
neurodegenerative pro-inﬂammatory response in microglia, and to some
extent in astrocytes as well. 

[CHUNK 4614]
All of these pathways converge with similar
deﬁcits that occur in normal aging to ultimately lead to neurodegeneration.


[CHUNK 4615]
CONCLUSION
The role of APOE4 in mediating AD risk is complex
and multifactorial, involving a diverse array of cell types
and functions that need to be taken into consideration
for APOE-directed drug development. 

[CHUNK 4616]
Studies from the last
decade have made significant progress in defining what
those functions are, and how aging might factor into the
progression of APOE4-mediated AD. 

[CHUNK 4617]
Cholesterol metabolism,
LD formation and lipid transfer from neurons to glia, and
glucose/glycogen/lactate metabolism from glia to neurons all
appear to be important pathways in maintaining brain health,
particularly during aging; and the pro-inflammatory nature
of APOE4 and decreased phagocytic capacity of APOE4-
expressing glia likely contributes to neurodegeneration as well
(Figure 6). 

[CHUNK 4618]
These pathways may yield viable therapeutic targets
for treating AD, but the precise mechanisms and connections
with APOE4 still remain poorly defined. 

[CHUNK 4619]
It is also unclear how
APOE4-mediated disrupted function in astrocytes and microglia
separately could synergize to increase AD risk, warranting
further investigation.

Introduction: Cortisol effects on the brain are exerted through two distinct receptors,
inducing complex and even opposite effects on the cerebral structures implicated in the
various cognitive functions. 

[CHUNK 5736]
High cortisol may also have deleterious effects on the brain
structures and contribute to neurodegeneration, in particular Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
via different mechanisms.


[CHUNK 5737]
Objective: To examine the interrelationships between cortisol, cognitive impairment
and AD.


[CHUNK 5738]
Methods: Review of the literature.


[CHUNK 5739]
Results: Clinical studies found that elevated cortisol was associated with poorer overall
cognitive functioning, as well as with poorer episodic memory, executive functioning,
language, spatial memory, processing speed, and social cognition; while in animals,
glucocorticoid administration resulted in cognitive impairment and abnormal behavior.


[CHUNK 5740]
In cognitively healthy subjects, higher cortisol levels have been associated with an
increased risk of cognitive decline and AD. 

[CHUNK 5741]
Subjects with dementia and Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) due to AD have been found to have higher CSF cortisol levels than
cognitively healthy controls. 

[CHUNK 5742]
Elevated CSF cortisol may also be associated with a more
rapid cognitive decline in MCI due to AD. 

[CHUNK 5743]
Elevated cortisol levels have been also
found in delirium. 

[CHUNK 5744]
High cortisol may mediate the impact of stressful life events, high
neuroticism, depression, sleep disturbances, as well as cardiovascular risk factors on
cognitive performance, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. 

[CHUNK 5745]
High cortisol may also
exert neurotoxic effects on the hippocampus, and promote oxidative stress and amyloid
β peptide toxicity. 

[CHUNK 5746]
Further possible underlying mechanisms include the interactions of
cortisol with inﬂammatory mediators, neurotransmitters, and growth factors.


[CHUNK 5747]
Conclusion: Elevated cortisol levels may exert detrimental effects on cognition and
contribute to AD pathology. 

[CHUNK 5748]
Further studies are needed to investigate cortisol-reducing
and glucocorticoidreceptor modulating interventions to prevent cognitive decline.

Cortisol and Alzheimer’s Disease: Review
INTRODUCTION
Corticosteroids seem to be among the hormones with the most
important eﬀects on the brain function. 

[CHUNK 5751]
Indeed, corticosteroids
have been associated with eﬀects on mood, stress, anxiety, sleep,
appetite, as well as cognition (Lupien et al., 2007; Wolkowitz et al.,
2009; Copinschi and Caufriez, 2013).


[CHUNK 5752]
Once released from the adrenal cortex, cortisol, the main
glucocorticoid in humans, easily crosses the blood–brain barrier,
owing to its lipophilic character (Wolkowitz et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 5753]
Cortisol
binds to speciﬁc intracellular receptors in the brain, in particular
in regions implicated in cognitive functions (McEwen, 2007;
Daskalakis et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 5754]
Once activated, these
receptors bind to “ hormone response elements” in the DNA and
regulate the transcription of target genes (Joels, 2006).


[CHUNK 5755]
The resulting eﬀects on cognition seem to be complex and
involve several cognitive domains (Lupien et al., 2007; Lee C.M.


[CHUNK 5756]
et al., 2008; Tatomir et al., 2014; Geerlings et al., 2015; Vogel et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 5757]
Diﬀerent levels of cortisol likely produce diﬀerent and
even sometimes opposite eﬀects (de Kloet et al., 1999; Joels, 2006).


[CHUNK 5758]
While some of these eﬀects are acute (Lupien and McEwen, 1997;
Lupien et al., 2002; Meir Drexler and Wolf, 2016), some appear
to be long-lasting and may even involve long-term changes in the
brain structure (Geerlings et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 5759]
Altered
Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal
(HPA)
axis
functioning, and in particular high cortisol levels in the
elderly have been associated with an increased risk for dementia
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Lupien et al., 1999; Rothman and
Mattson, 2010; Ennis et al., 2017; Notarianni, 2017).


[CHUNK 5760]
A better understanding of these interrelationships between
cortisol, cognition and dementia may open the door to new
prevention and therapeutic options involving the HPA axis. 

[CHUNK 5761]
The
eﬀects of cortisol on emotional memory had already led to
therapeutic trials of corticosteroids and corticosteroid receptor
antagonists/modulators in AD (Pineau et al., 2016), as well as
in treating or preventing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
(Daskalakis et al., 2013), as well as in treating depression
(Wolkowitz and Reus, 1999; Kling et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 5762]
GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS AND
CORTISOL EFFECTS ON COGNITION
Cortisol exerts its eﬀects on cognition through two types of
receptors: type I (Mineralocorticoid Receptors, MRs) and type
II (Glucocorticoid Receptors, GRs) (Joels, 2006; Daskalakis et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 5763]
Surprisingly, the MRs display 6 to 10 times higher aﬃnity
for glucocorticoids, mainly cortisol, than GRs (de Kloet et al.,
1999; Joels, 2006).


[CHUNK 5764]
These receptors are expressed diﬀerently throughout the
brain. 

[CHUNK 5765]
Indeed, the hippocampus, mainly implicated in episodic
memory, expresses both MRs and GRs, whilst the prefrontal
cortex, primarily responsible for executive functions, only
expresses GRs (Lupien et al., 2007; McEwen, 2007). 

[CHUNK 5766]
While
MRs have been associated with positive/enhancing eﬀects on
the cognitive performance, GRs have, on the contrary, been
linked to negative inhibitory eﬀects. 

[CHUNK 5767]
In this regard, it has
been found that infusion of a GR antagonist, but not of MR
antagonist, in the medial prefrontal cortex of a mouse blocked
the deleterious eﬀects of glucocorticoids on working memory
(Barsegyan et al., 2010).


[CHUNK 5768]
Cortisol
eﬀects
on
the
hippocampus-related
cognitive
performance have often been described by the means of an
inverted-U shape plot (Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 5769]
Indeed, in the hippocampus,
where both GRs and MRs are expressed, moderate levels of
cortisol only activate the receptors with the higher aﬃnity,
i.e., MRs, leading to memory enhancement eﬀects. 

[CHUNK 5770]
As cortisol
levels increase, this positive eﬀect increases till MRs are
saturated. 

[CHUNK 5771]
Starting from this point, as cortisol levels rise, GRs are
increasingly activated thus leading to increasingly detrimental
eﬀects on the memory. 

[CHUNK 5772]
Distinctly, the eﬀects of cortisol on
executive functions are likely more linear. 

[CHUNK 5773]
Since the prefrontal
cortex region, mostly responsible for executive functions, only
expresses GRs, higher levels of cortisol may lead to worsened
executive functioning (Figure 2; Lupien et al., 2007; McEwen,
2007). 

[CHUNK 5774]
The fact that both adrenal insuﬃciency and Cushing’s
disease have been associated with impaired declarative memory
(Forget et al., 2016; Tiemensma et al., 2016) bolsters this biphasic
eﬀect hypothesis. 

[CHUNK 5775]
Another argument is that the administration
of the MR agonist ﬂudrocortisone has been found to improve
verbal and visuospatial memory performance in young as well as
elderly healthy subjects (Hinkelmann et al., 2015); whereas the
administration of hydrocortisone (mimicking the endogenous
cortisol eﬀects on both GRs and MRs) has been shown to
enhance at lower doses yet impair at higher doses verbal memory
retrieval in healthy subjects (Domes et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 5776]
These eﬀects that cortisol exerts on the brain structures
involved in cognition are possibly mediated by modiﬁcations
in responses to serotonin, in β-adrenergic receptor activation,
in calcium inﬂux, as well as in long-term potentiation
(LTP), a process referring to a long-term strengthening of
synaptic connections contributing to memory formation and
consolidation (Joels, 2006; Lupien et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 5777]
Indeed, GR
activation facilitates β-adrenergic signaling thus leading to the
formation of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)
and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 

[CHUNK 5778]
This pathway,
once activated, is thought to inhibit the medial prefrontal
cortex thus leading to an impairment in frontal functions,
in particular working memory (McGaugh and Roozendaal,
2002; Barsegyan et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 5779]
Glucocorticoids have also been
found to display certain eﬀects on the hippocampus via actions
on the serotoninergic system following the same biphasic
pattern as described in Figure 1. 

[CHUNK 5780]
Indeed, glucocorticoids can
promote via MRs and, at the same time, inhibit via GRs
the 5HT1A activation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells
(de Kloet et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 5781]
Moreover, glucocorticoids have been reported to alter LTP
in opposite directions depending on the MR/GR activation
ratio: when the MR/GR activation ratio is high (central part of
the inverted U-shaped plot, Figure 1), LTP is enhanced thus
improving long-term memory consolidation. 

[CHUNK 5782]
On the contrary,
when the MR/GR ratio is low (extremes of the inverted U-shaped
plot, Figure 1), LTP is suppressed thus worsening long-term
memory consolidation (de Kloet et al., 1999; Lupien et al., 2007).

Cortisol and Alzheimer’s Disease: Review
FIGURE 1 | Dose–response relationship between the memory performance and the cortisol levels. 

[CHUNK 5785]
The ﬁrst part of the plot shows that memory performance
increases as cortisol levels increase (due to the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors or MRs). 

[CHUNK 5786]
As soon as the MRs are saturated, further increase in cortisol levels
activates the glucocorticoids receptors or GRs and memory performance decreases.

FIGURE 2 | Hypothetical dose–response relationship between the executive
functions performance and the cortisol levels. 

[CHUNK 5790]
As the prefrontal cortex only
expresses GRs, the higher the cortisol levels, the poorer the executive
functions performance.


[CHUNK 5791]
In clinical studies, most studies examining the link between
cortisol levels and global cognitive performance among non-
demented older adults found that higher cortisol levels have been
associated with poorer overall cognitive performance (Lupien
et al., 2007; Lee B.K. 

[CHUNK 5792]
et al., 2008; Ouanes et al., 2017a; Sang
et al., 2018).

Likewise, most (Beluche et al., 2010; Geerlings
et al., 2015; Segerstrom et al., 2016; Ouanes et al., 2017a,b;
Echouﬀo-Tcheugui et al., 2018), even though not all (Lee B.K.


[CHUNK 5794]
et al., 2008) studies exploring the relationship between episodic
memory and cortisol levels have found an association between
elevated cortisol and poorer episodic memory among older adults
without dementia. 

[CHUNK 5795]
These ﬁndings suggest that, even at levels that
are within the normal range, cortisol can still activate GRs, and
not just MRs. 

[CHUNK 5796]
This also suggests that relatively small diﬀerences
in cortisol levels can exhibit signiﬁcant eﬀects on memory
performance. 

[CHUNK 5797]
Studies exploring the relationship between cortisol
levels and prefrontal cortex-mediated cognitive functions, mainly
executive functions, processing speed and working memory,
have found more discrepant results: while the expected negative
association was reported in certain studies (Lee B.K. 

[CHUNK 5798]
et al.,
2008; Beluche et al., 2010; Geerlings et al., 2015), other studies
failed to ﬁnd such an association (Ouanes et al., 2017a,b;
Echouﬀo-Tcheugui et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 5799]
The diﬀerences in populations, assessment tools, as well as
the likely eﬀects of possible confounding factors including age,
gender, educational level, as well as other neuroendocrine and
psychological factors might explain these discrepancies.

CORTISOL AND CEREBRAL
STRUCTURAL CHANGES
High cortisol has also been linked to decreased volume of
several brain regions involved in cognitive functions. 

[CHUNK 5801]
In fact, in
a study by Geerlings et al. 

[CHUNK 5802]
(2015) involving 4244 non-demented
subjects, elevated evening cortisol was found to be associated
with decreased volumes in all brain regions, in particular the
gray matter (Geerlings et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 5803]
Similar ﬁndings have
been reported in the dementia-free Framingham Heart Study
participants: elevated cortisol was associated with decreased total
brain volume, in particular decreased occipital and frontal gray
matter volumes. 

[CHUNK 5804]
In the same study, increased cortisol levels were
associated with some microstructural changes, speciﬁcally in the
corpus callosum and the posterior corona radiate (Echouﬀo-
Tcheugui et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 5805]
In addition, high levels of cortisol have been linked to
hippocampal atrophy (Tatomir et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 5806]
This atrophy
can
be
the
consequence
of
the
exposure
to
increased
cortisol levels.

Cortisol and Alzheimer’s Disease: Review
FIGURE 3 | (A) In normal circumstances, the CRF released by the hypothalamus activates ACTH release by the pituitary gland, which stimulates the adrenal glands
to secrete cortisol. 

[CHUNK 5818]
Cortisol inhibits its own secretion via a negative feedback loop. 

[CHUNK 5819]
The hippocampus inhibits the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. 

[CHUNK 5820]
(B) When
cortisol is elevated, it can induce hippocampal atrophy, which “lifts the brake” on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. 

[CHUNK 5821]
The resulting cortisol increase induces
further hippocampal atrophy, resulting in a vicious circle. 

[CHUNK 5822]
CRF, corticotropin-releasing factor; ACTH, Adrenocorticotropic hormone.


[CHUNK 5823]
hippocampal atrophy is reversed following treatment and
normalization of the cortisol levels (Starkman et al., 1999).


[CHUNK 5824]
Yet, this atrophy can also be a cause of the elevated cortisol
levels. 

[CHUNK 5825]
Indeed, the hippocampus exerts an inhibitory eﬀect
on the HPA axis activity, and hence hippocampal atrophy
might disinhibit the HPA axis leading to increased cortisol
(Geerlings et al., 2015; Figure 3).


[CHUNK 5826]
These eﬀects on the hippocampal volume may be partly due to
changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression
in the hippocampus (Suri and Vaidya, 2013). 

[CHUNK 5827]
Similarly to their
eﬀects on cognitive performance, MR activation seems to increase
whereas GR activation seems to decrease BDNF expression in the
hippocampus (Kino et al., 2010; Suri and Vaidya, 2013).


[CHUNK 5828]
In a study by Cox et al. 

[CHUNK 5829]
(2015) elevated salivary cortisol
levels at the start and at the end of a cognitive task
appointment have been associated with a poorer white matter
structure, i.e., greater white matter hyperintensity volume
and/or elevated general factor of tract mean diﬀusivity. 

[CHUNK 5830]
These
ﬁndings suggest that aside from the “acute eﬀects” of cortisol
on cognition, chronically elevated cortisol levels likely bring
about brain structural changes that may reﬂect long-term
cognitive deﬁcits.

HPA-AXIS DYSREGULATION, CORTISOL
AND ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
PATHOLOGY, DISEASE RISK AND
CLINICAL COURSE
Glucocorticoids have been reported to promote oxidative stress
and to increase amyloid β (Aβ) peptide toxicity in cultured
hippocampal neurons (Goodman et al., 1996). 

[CHUNK 5832]
Besides, in
a mouse model of AD, elevated cortisol has been linked
to exacerbated Aβ peptide and tau pathology in the brain
(Green et al., 2006).


[CHUNK 5833]
In primates, year-long high-dose exposure to glucocorticoids
was associated with decreased insulin-degrading enzyme levels,
a candidate protease for the clearance of Aβ in the brain. 

[CHUNK 5834]
At the
same time, the Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio was increased indicating a
relative shift toward increased production of the more brain toxic
Aβ1-42 (Kulstad et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 5835]
In a cross-sectional study examining the links between
cardiovascular risk factors and Aβ brain burden as determined
by Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-
PET), an association has been found between plasma cortisol and
Aβ brain burden (Toledo et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 5836]
Together, these ﬁndings suggest that increased cortisol may
induce and/or exacerbate cerebral AD pathology by increasing
Aβ brain burden, tau pathology as well as oxidative stress,
which can all contribute to neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 5837]
Eﬀects on Aβ
likely entail decreasing Aβ clearance as well as promoting
the cleavage of Aβ into the most toxic compound (Aβ1-42)
(Kulstad et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 5838]
The aforementioned cerebral changes associated with elevated
cortisol likely translate into ﬁndings of associations between
increased cortisol levels and clinical features of AD, as shown
in several clinical studies that reported increased cortisol levels
in patients with clinical AD dementia (Dong and Csernansky,
2009; Popp et al., 2009; Ennis et al., 2017), and cortisol levels have
even been found to correlate with the severity of the cognitive

Cortisol and Alzheimer’s Disease: Review
positive PET imaging, high cortisol levels have been found to be
associated with a faster decline in global cognition, in episodic
memory, as well as in executive functioning, independently
of age, sex, APOE genotype, or anxiety symptoms (Pietrzak
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 5843]
In a population based cohort study in 537 non-
demented older adults (65 years or more at baseline), we found
salivary cortisol day proﬁles to be not associated with faster
cognitive decline over an average 5.3 years. 

[CHUNK 5844]
However, preliminary
analysis suggests that higher morning salivary cortisol measures
may be associated with slight decline in global cognition
(Albanese et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 5845]
Higher plasma cortisol levels in patients with AD dementia
have been associated with a more rapid cognitive decline in some
studies (Pedersen et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 5846]
Similarly,
Csernansky et al. 

[CHUNK 5847]
(2006) found that high plasma cortisol levels
were associated with faster cognitive decline in individuals with
very mild or mild AD dementia.


[CHUNK 5848]
In a cohort study from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) investigating biomarkers able to predict
progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD within
1–6 years, plasma cortisol was one of the six biomarkers found to
provide an accurate prediction (Lehallier et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 5849]
Moreover, cortisol concentrations in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) have been found to be higher in subjects with dementia
and MCI due to AD compared to control subjects (Popp
et al., 2009, 2015). 

[CHUNK 5850]
In MCI due to AD, high CSF cortisol
was also predictive of a more rapid cognitive decline (Popp
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 5851]
Hence, elevated cortisol appears to contribute to
exacerbate AD brain pathology, thereby contributing to the
disease progression both pathologically and clinically. 

[CHUNK 5852]
Cortisol
levels appear to be increased at early stages of AD, and fasting
plasma and CSF cortisol levels may even be pre-clinical markers
(Notarianni, 2017).


[CHUNK 5853]
These
ﬁndings
may
be
explained
by
increased
Aβ
neurotoxicity related to higher cortisol levels as well as
neurodegeneration
and
functional
impairment
of
the
hippocampus occurring early in the course of the disease
as both a consequence of exposure to high cortisol levels
and a cause of HPA axis disinhibition, hence a vicious circle
(Geerlings et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 5854]
CORTISOL, COGNITION AND
MEDIATING FACTORS
Certain factors may further explain the links between cortisol,
cognitive impairment and dementia. 

[CHUNK 5855]
Indeed, some of these
factors may bring about HPA axis alterations that could aﬀect
cognition and the risk for dementia, in particular AD. 

[CHUNK 5856]
These
factors may include life events (Ouanes et al., 2017a), personality
(Ouanes et al., 2017b; Tautvydaite et al., 2017; Terracciano et al.,
2017), sleep disorders (Haba-Rubio et al., 2017), depression
(Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 5857]
At the same time, some other factors such as metabolic
syndrome, insulin resistance and eﬀects on inﬂammation may
mediate the eﬀects of cortisol on cognition and brain structural
changes (Kim and Feldman, 2015; Martocchia et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 5858]
Cortisol, Cognition, Trauma and Life
Events
Early trauma (of physical, sexual or emotional nature) has been
linked to long-term cognitive deﬁcits in adulthood (consisting
in impaired spatial working memory and pattern recognition
memory) in a study by Majer et al. 

[CHUNK 5859]
(2010); however, this ﬁnding
was not replicated in other studies (Saigh et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 5860]
Early
stress has also been shown to be associated with structural
and functional changes in brain regions involved in cognitive
functions, including the frontal cortex as well as the hippocampus
(Lupien et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 5861]
Early trauma is also one of the most important established risk
factors for PTSD. 

[CHUNK 5862]
PTSD has been shown to be associated with
an increased risk of dementia in both genders over an average of
8 years of follow-up (hazard ratio: 1.73[1.47, 2.02]) (Flatt et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 5863]
Nevertheless, Burri et al. 

[CHUNK 5864]
(2013) found that the long-term
cognitive deﬁcits associated with PTSD were likely independent
of earlier childhood adversity.


[CHUNK 5865]
Aside from early trauma and PTSD, stressful life events have
often been associated with HPA activation. 

[CHUNK 5866]
Yet, some studies,
conversely, showed decreased cortisol following stressful life
events (Miller et al., 2007; Daskalakis et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 5867]
Results of
the studies exploring the relationship between life events and
cognition have been discrepant. 

[CHUNK 5868]
On the one hand, several studies
highlighted associations between stressful events and poorer
subsequent cognitive performance, in particular in memory
and executive functions (Xavier et al., 2002; VonDras et al.,
2005; van Gelder et al., 2006; Lupien et al., 2007) above
and beyond the impact of depression (Comijs et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 5869]
Importantly, stressful events have been also associated with an
elevated risk of late-life dementia (Johansson et al., 2010) and
late-life cerebral atrophy, and white matter lesions (Johansson
et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 5870]
On the other hand, other studies failed to ﬁnd
any association between stressful life events and cognitive
performance in the elderly (Ward et al., 2007; Fountoulakis
et al., 2011; Sundstrom et al., 2014) and some even showed a
possible improvement in cognition following certain stressful
events (Deeg et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 5871]
In a study exploring the mediation hypothesis between
cortisol, life events and cognition in 796 non-demented subjects
aged at least 65 we found elevated salivary cortisol levels to be
linked to poorer cognitive performance, but this association was
not related to life events (Ouanes et al., 2017a).


[CHUNK 5872]
These discrepancies regarding the relationships between life
events and cortisol on the one hand, and life events and cognition
on the other hand, may be explained by diﬀerent life events
displaying diﬀerent eﬀects on cortisol and thus on cognition
(Ouanes et al., 2017a).


[CHUNK 5873]
Cortisol, Cognition and Personality
High neuroticism is the personality trait most consistently often
associated with high cortisol (Bridges and Jones, 1968; van
Eck et al., 1996; Miller et al., 1999, 2016; Portella et al., 2005;
Yoshino et al., 2005; Gerritsen et al., 2009; Nater et al., 2010;
Garcia-Banda et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 5874]
However, other studies found no
association (Adler et al., 1997; Schommer et al., 1999; Ferguson,

[CHUNK 5875]
Ouanes and Popp
Cortisol and Alzheimer’s Disease: Review
2008), or even an opposite link (Ballenger et al., 1983; LeBlanc
and Ducharme, 2005).


[CHUNK 5876]
Higher neuroticism has also been reported to be cross-
sectionally linked to lower cognitive performance above and
beyond the eﬀects of depression (Jorm et al., 1993; Boyle et al.,
2010), especially to poorer episodic memory (Jorm et al., 1993;
Meier et al., 2002; Klaming et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 5877]
In addition, high
neuroticism scores have been found in association with elevated
risk of AD (Terracciano et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 5878]
A few studies examined the relationship between the other
personality traits and cognitive performance and risk of
dementia. 

[CHUNK 5879]
Lower pre-morbid conscientiousness, agreeableness,
openness and extraversion have been associated, although not
consistently, with lower cognitive performance and higher risk
for AD (Terracciano et al., 2014, 2017; Tautvydaite et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 5880]
In
a cohort of memory clinic patients and cognitively healthy elderly
volunteers we found lower extraversion and openness to correlate
with CSF markers of AD pathology: tau, ptau-181, tau/Aβ1–
42, and ptau-181/Aβ1–42 ratios, but not with the Aβ1–42 level
(Tautvydaite et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 5881]
In
a
population-based
cohort
study
examining
the
interrelationships between cortisol, cognition and personality
traits, salivary cortisol did not seem to mediate the link between
personality traits and cognitive deﬁcits (Ouanes et al., 2017b).


[CHUNK 5882]
Besides
methodological
diﬀerences,
these
observed
discrepancies may be due to the impact of depression and/or
anxiety which has been controlled for in a few studies but
not in others, but also to the diﬃculties (in cross-sectional
studies,
mainly)
to
disentangle
pre-morbid
personality
traits from the personality modiﬁcations accompanying the
cognitive decline.


[CHUNK 5883]
Cortisol, Cognition and Sleep Disorders
Cognitive impairment has been associated with more time
spent in stage N1 (ﬁrst step of non-rapid eye movement
sleep) and less in stage N3 (third step of non-rapid eye
movement sleep) and in REM sleep, lower sleep eﬃciency,
and more wake after sleep onset, as well as more severe sleep
disordered breathing (as evidenced by higher apnea/hypopnea
index or AHI, and higher oxygen desaturation index or ODI)
(Haba-Rubio et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 5884]
In a study of the same research group, involving 456 elderly
non-demented subjects, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been
found to be linked to cognitive impairment, but the relationship
did not appear to be mediated by diurnal cortisol levels (Haba-
Rubio et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 5885]
In other studies, OSA has been associated with increased
nocturnal plasma cortisol levels (Chopra et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 5886]
Edwards
et al. 

[CHUNK 5887]
(2014) found that higher night-time cortisol was
associated with worse cognitive performance, mainly aﬀecting
memory, above and beyond the apnea severity in a sample of
patients with OSA.


[CHUNK 5888]
Taken
together,
the
results
of
these
studies
highlight
links between cognitive performance and sleep disorders
on
the
one
hand,
and
between
cortisol
levels
and
cognitive
functioning
on
the
other
hand,
but
do
not
provide
evidence
to
support
that
cortisol
may
actually
mediate
the
relationship
between
sleep
disorders
and
cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 5889]
Cortisol, Cognition and Depression
Depression has been associated, on the one hand with HPA
axis hyperactivity and impaired negative feedback (Anacker
et al., 2011), and on the other hand with cognitive deﬁcits
involving attention, episodic memory and executive functions
(Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 5890]
Depression has also been tied
to late-life dementia, in particular with vascular and AD
dementia (Brunnstrom et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 5891]
This association is not
just a mere comorbidity, as late-life depression may also be
a risk factor for both AD and vascular dementia (Diniz
et al., 2013; Herbert and Lucassen, 2016). 

[CHUNK 5892]
In the AGES-
Reykjavik population-based study (Geerlings et al., 2017), both
current major depressive disorder and high evening cortisol
levels were associated with an higher risk of incident AD
and non-AD dementia, but cortisol did not seem to be a
major factor explaining the relation between depression and
risk of dementia.


[CHUNK 5893]
Some of the observed cognitive deﬁcits in verbal and visual
memory and executive functions may remain present even after
the depressive symptoms fully remitted (Herrera-Guzman et al.,
2010; Rock et al., 2014; Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 5894]
Likewise,
the HPA axis abnormalities associated with depression may
persist even after remission (Lok et al., 2012; Salvat-Pujol et al.,
2017), possibly constituting trait rather than state markers for
depression, even though this remains a matter of debate (Zverova
et al., 2013; Salvat-Pujol et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 5895]
Remission

association
between
cognitive
performance
and

the
increase
in

after
awakening
(Fries
et

2009).


[CHUNK 5896]
However, remission appeared to moderate the association
between cortisol slope deﬁned by the diﬀerence between
maximal and minimal cortisol levels during the nyctemera,
and
certain
cognitive
tasks
assessing
processing
speed
and
executive
function
(Salvat-Pujol
et

[CHUNK 5897]
HPA
axis
alteration
in
depression
may
inhibit
neurogenesis,
partly
through
reducing
BDNF
which
is
involved
in
hippocampal neurogenesis, thus possibly explaining one of
the mechanisms by which depression may be a risk factor for AD
(Herbert and Lucassen, 2016).


[CHUNK 5898]
Delirium is common in AD, and it is associated with
more
rapid
clinical
disease
progression
(Popp,
2013).


[CHUNK 5899]
Depression symptoms and cognitive impairment have been
independently
associated
with
higher
risk
of
developing
delirium. 

[CHUNK 5900]
In a yet-to be-published study by the same team,
increased cortisol levels have been observed in patients with
delirium suggesting HPA axis dysregulation to be involved
in the pathophysiology of delirium.

In a cohort of elderly

Cortisol and Alzheimer’s Disease: Review
Whether and how HPA axis dysregulation and increased
cortisol
levels
may
contribute
to
the
magnitude
of
cognitive
and
non-cognitive
symptoms
in
AD,
needs
further
investigation.


[CHUNK 5905]
In
a
study
in
patients
with
AD
dementia,
plasma
cortisol
levels
have
been
shown
to
reﬂect the degree of cognitive deﬁcits in AD dementia
rather
than
the
severity
of
the
comorbid
depression
(Zverova et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 5906]
Altogether, these data suggest that, mostly, cognitive deﬁcits
linked to increased cortisol and HPA axis dysregulation
cannot be entirely explained by a co-occurring depressive
disorder. 

[CHUNK 5907]
AD pathology may exacerbate HPA axis dysregulation
which may contribute to the manifestation of depressive
symptoms
and
to
the
severity
of
cognitive
impairment
and increase the risk of other non-cognitive syndromes,
including delirium. 

[CHUNK 5908]
Even though depression-associated HPA
axis dysregulation may predispose to and/or exacerbate the
course of AD (Herbert and Lucassen, 2016), studies suggest a
link between HPA axis dysregulation and AD itself above and
beyond depression.


[CHUNK 5909]
Cortisol, Cognition and the Metabolic
Syndrome
Elevated cortisol levels have been tied to insulin resistance
and metabolic syndrome, which in turn, have been associated
with both AD and vascular dementia. 

[CHUNK 5910]
(Kim and Feldman,
2015; Martocchia et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 5911]
Hence, elevated cortisol may
lead,
through
its
metabolic
syndrome-associated
eﬀects
on
glucose,
blood
pressure
and
lipids,
to
an
increased
cardiovascular risk (Lattanzi and Silvestrini, 2017). 

[CHUNK 5912]
Indeed,
higher cortisol has been associated with a higher number
of
carotid
plaques
(Hamer
et
al.,
2010).


[CHUNK 5913]
The
resulting
vascular lesions in the brain may directly induce cognitive
disturbances, but can also contribute to the neurodegeneration
observed in AD (Attems and Jellinger, 2014). 

[CHUNK 5914]
Moreover, insulin
resistance itself may negatively inﬂuence the amyloid cascade
(Stefanelli et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 5915]
At the same time, AD-associated hypercortisolemia, present
at very early stages, may also induce pre-diabetes. 

[CHUNK 5916]
The
resulting increased insulin secretion can further exacerbate the
hypercortisolemia, thus possibly negatively aﬀecting the course
of AD (Notarianni, 2017).


[CHUNK 5917]
Cortisol, Cognition and Inﬂammation
While cortisol is generally known to exert broad anti-
inﬂammatory
eﬀects,
high
cortisol
levels
may
activate
NACHT,
LRR
and
PYD
domains-containing
protein
1
(NLRP-1)
inﬂammasome
in
hippocampal
neurons,
thus
promoting neuroinﬂammation and thereby neuronal injury
(Zhang et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 5918]
Moreover,
certain
cytokines,
in
particular
IL-1-
Beta
and
IL-6,
which
are
also
known
to
be
involved
in
the
pathophysiology
of
AD,
can
activate
the
HPA
axis
(Besedovsky
and
del
Rey,
2000).


[CHUNK 5919]
The
resulting
increased cortisol can reinforce the toxic eﬀects on the
hippocampus
exerted
by
the
pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines
(Sudheimer
et
al.,
2014),
thus
contributing
to
the
pathophysiology of AD.


[CHUNK 5920]
CORTISOL AND POTENTIAL
PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC
INTERVENTIONS FOR ALZHEIMER’S
DISEASE:
Since increased cortisol has been associated with both AD
pathology and more rapid clinical disease progression, and
since most detrimental eﬀects of cortisol are likely exerted
via GRs, therapeutic interventions targeting the GRs have
been investigated. 

[CHUNK 5921]
Indeed, the GR antagonist mifepristone has
been shown to decrease both Aβ and tau load in the brain
as well as to improve the pathologically induced cognitive
impairments in a triple-transgenic (3xTg AD) mouse model
of AD (Baglietto-Vargas et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 5922]
In a similar way,
mifepristone has been shown to reduce the hippocampal Aβ
levels and rescue the cognitive deﬁcits induced by early life
stress in APP/PS1 transgenic mice (Lesuis et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 5923]
As
these pathological processes start years or even decades before
the onset of the ﬁrst symptoms, cortisol lowering or cortisol
eﬀects modulating interventions in midlife may slow down
the development of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration,
and prevent cognitive decline in later life (Lante et al., 2015;
Lesuis et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 5924]
Such interventions could prove useful,
in particular in subjects at risk for developing clinical AD
(Pietrzak et al., 2017) and prone to stress, and HPA-axis
dysregulation. 

[CHUNK 5925]
Prevention trials with focus on cortisol or HPA-
axis in human subjects with normal cognition have not been
reported so far, however.


[CHUNK 5926]
One randomized controlled trial in a small sample of patients
with mild to moderate AD dementia showed improvement of
cognitive performance in memory tasks, but the premature
termination did not allow any ﬁrm conclusions regarding eﬃcacy
(Pomara et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 5927]
Other trials using mifepristone that were
initiated were terminated without being published, indicating
that these trials were not completed, or yielded negative results
(O’Banion, 2013).


[CHUNK 5928]
Also, several non-pharmacological intervention in subjects
with MCI (Baker et al., 2010) or dementia (Woods et al., 2009;
Schaub et al., 2018) have shown cortisol lowering eﬀects.


[CHUNK 5929]
However, there has been some loss of interest in GR
antagonists because of their side eﬀects due to GRs being
ubiquitous, especially as more selective molecules, namely GR
modulators have been developed (Canet et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 5930]
Glucocorticoid
Receptor
modulators
have
been
shown
to normalize basal glucocorticoid plasma levels, decrease
hippocampal Aβ peptide deposition, inhibit neuroinﬂammation,
and apoptotic processes, and improve cognitive performance in
a mouse model of AD (Pineau et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 5931]
Another potential mechanism by which cortisol eﬀects can
be reduced pharmacologically is the inhibition of cortisol
synthesis, one of the key enzymes being the 11β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1).

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
This narrative review provides a concise overview of the
diﬀerent molecular, cellular, and clinical (including diagnostic,
prognostic, and therapeutic) aspects of the interrelationships
between cortisol, cognition, dementia, and AD. 

[CHUNK 5935]
However, it does
not cover all possible facets of these complex relationships. 

[CHUNK 5936]
We
focused on the most important and the most clinically relevant
aspects of the topic, rather going in depth into one particular
aspect of the topic.


[CHUNK 5937]
CONCLUSION
There is a growing body of evidence that increased cortisol may
be deleterious for the late-life cognitive performance, and may
be associated with an increased risk for cognitive decline and
dementia, in particular dementia due to AD. 

[CHUNK 5938]
In patients with AD,
the increased cortisol at preclinical and early clinical stages is
associated with a poorer prognosis and a more rapid cognitive
decline. 

[CHUNK 5939]
Increased cortisol may represent a pathophysiological
mediator between stressful life events, personality, mood, and
sleep, and may increase both the risk of AD and the extent
of symptoms at clinical stages of the disease. 

[CHUNK 5940]
Yet, the exact
underlying mediating factors are not fully understood. 

[CHUNK 5941]
Direct
deleterious cortisol eﬀects on the hippocampus and on the
prefrontal cortex are likely, but also cortisol links with metabolic
syndrome and neuroinﬂammation; and HPA axis disinhibition
due to neurodegeneration are other possible mechanisms that
may explain the association of cortisol with late-life cognitive
impairment and AD.


[CHUNK 5942]
Further studies are needed to conﬁrm the value of cortisol
levels as a possible preclinical marker associated with higher risk,
and/or as a prognostic parameter in subjects with clinical AD.


[CHUNK 5943]
Future research may also bring in new HPA-based interventions
for the prevention and/or management of symptoms, and of the
clinical progression of AD.

Crucially, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with progressive loss in

INTRODUCTION
Recently, it was estimated that more than 47 million elderly people are aﬀected by dementia globally
(Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2009; Prince et al., 2016) and that an additional 131 million
people will develop this health-challenging syndrome by 2050 (Prince et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6674]
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), a progressive condition causing behavioral changes, memory loss, and decline in
learning capacity (Anand et al., 2014), is the most common cause of dementia worldwide (Hardy,
1997). 

[CHUNK 6675]
Most cases of AD occur in individuals over the age of 75, but, relatively younger individuals,
including those carrying certain genetic mutations (Loy et al., 2014), may develop the disease before
65 years of age (Alzheimer’s Association, 2015).


[CHUNK 6676]
Knowledge of the brain changes that occur in AD has increased remarkably from the late 20th
century due to extensive research on a range of related neurodegenerative processes. 

[CHUNK 6677]
Particular
progress has been made with regard to what has been termed the pathological ‘hallmarks’ of AD –
the presence of amyloid plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) – which detrimentally aﬀect
axons, dendrites, and synapses (Vickers et al., 2000, 2016). 

[CHUNK 6678]
Plaques are the result of accumulations of
an abnormal form of the beta amyloid (Aβ) protein in the brain. 

[CHUNK 6679]
NFTs are formed by the aggregation
of aberrant tau protein (Vickers et al., 2000; Savva et al., 2009) and are more directly related to the

Pietzuch et al.


[CHUNK 6681]
Resting-State Networks in Alzheimer’s Disease
death of neurons (Jacobs et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 6682]
Within the cerebral
cortex, the earliest plaques are usually found in the neocortex,
whilst initial formation of tangles occurs in medial temporal
lobe (MTL) structures, such as the entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus (Price
and Morris,
1999).


[CHUNK 6683]
The
MTL is
a
very important region responsible for memory formation
and long-term memory (Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991).


[CHUNK 6684]
Throughout the cerebral cortex, neurons that provide long
corticocortical connections are the most prone to NFT-
induced deterioration (Morrison and Hof, 1997), which may
then underlie the pattern of synaptic loss seen in AD.


[CHUNK 6685]
Entorhinal-hippocampal circuits are compromised early in
AD, followed by the gradual disconnection of the MTL, and
then the loss of connectivity between association neocortices
(Morrison and Hof, 1997). 

[CHUNK 6686]
This pattern of progressive and
degenerative pathology may underlie the deterioration of
certain cognitive functions during aging, leading eventually
to frank AD. 

[CHUNK 6687]
The early pathological accumulation of Aβ
has been linked to cognitive impairment and could also
aﬀect functional connectivity between spatially distant brain
regions (Delbeuck et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 6688]
A summary table of studies
examining functional connectivity and Aβ in healthy aging
and AD can be found in Table 1. 

[CHUNK 6689]
Neuroimaging is a vital
component of international research collaborations (Hendrix
et al., 2015) and has been used to investigate mechanisms of
interrupted structural and functional connectivity underlying
the course of AD (Dennis and Thompson, 2014). 

[CHUNK 6690]
A better
understanding of how the pathological changes in AD aﬀect
the organization of brain networks, or how these networks
may respond or adapt to accumulating pathology, might
oﬀer further insights into the potential scope of functional
resilience. 

[CHUNK 6691]
The term resilience is described as the capability
of a tissue to be resistant to damage (Cosco et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 6692]
In this respect, factors such as education and lifestyle could
increase resilience by heightened connectional redundancy
and/or preserving functional connections in the brain, and
may ultimately delay the clinical expression of AD pathology.


[CHUNK 6693]
Indeed, studies investigating the association of education and
cognitive decline in AD have found that more highly educated
individuals are able to tolerate more neuropathology before
the clinical expression of AD (Bennett et al., 2003), potentially
because education moderates the relationship between brain
pathological load and cognitive impairments (Brayne et al.,
2010; Valenzuela et al., 2011), as well as functional connections
(Marques et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 6694]
Studies have shown that functional connectivity is damaged
or interrupted in AD (Stam et al., 2006, 2008), and, conversely,
investigating the impact of AD on structural and functional
networks may also provide more accurate information regarding
brain connectivity and how brain regions communicate with
each other (Sheline and Raichle, 2013). 

[CHUNK 6695]
This review focuses
on the methods with which brain connectivity is analyzed,
the changes in structural and functional networks found in
AD, and the role of cognitive reserve and speciﬁc genetic
factors in partially determining functional brain connectivity.


[CHUNK 6696]
In this regard, potential changes in functional connectivity
and resistance to pathology will involve both non-modiﬁable
and modiﬁable factors that will impact on how brain systems
respond to accumulating pathological burden. 

[CHUNK 6697]
Hence, we discuss
features of structural and functional brain networks in relation to
genetic biomarkers and environmental factors linked to AD risk,
progression and resilience.


[CHUNK 6698]
METHODS TO ANALYZE CONNECTIVITY
Neuroimaging techniques (Figure 1), such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), have long been used to investigate anatomical
connections,
detect
pathological
alterations,
and
monitor
the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD
(Figure 1A). 

[CHUNK 6699]
MRI involves the generation of a strong static
magnetic ﬁeld to create images and to map ﬂuctuation signals
related to brain activity (Heeger and Ress, 2002). 

[CHUNK 6700]
MRI also
allows the quantiﬁcation of brain atrophy, which can be used to
distinguish normal brain aging from AD (Frankó et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 6701]
For example, a recent study found that MRI and cognitive testing
in cognitively healthy individuals are useful tools for predicting
the development of AD, particularly when investigating the
progress from healthy cognition to the appearance of mild
cognitive impairments (MCIs) after 5 years (Albert et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 6702]
The delayed presence of clinical symptoms makes it challenging
to diagnose individuals in preclinical stages. 

[CHUNK 6703]
Therefore, animal
models could provide an opportunity to identify biomarkers
of early disease (Sabbagh et al., 2013), which include insights
from neuroimaging, such as gray and white matter alterations
measured by diﬀusion tensor imaging (DTI; Weston et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 6704]
Diﬀusion tensor imaging is an MRI-based neuroimaging
method that measures the diﬀusion of water molecules, enabling
the assessment of the ﬁber-tract structures of white matter
(Jones et al., 2013; Teipel et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6705]
This technique allows
the strengths and diﬀerences of white matter tract connections
in speciﬁc population groups to be compared (Jones et al.,
2013) before a reduction of cognition is evident (López-Gil
et al., 2014), for example between older individuals with and
without AD (Figure 1C). 

[CHUNK 6706]
Other structural imaging parameters
that are currently used to gain further insight into the integrity
of the brain over the life include intracranial volume and
the presence and number of white matter hyper-intensities
(Bartrés-Faz and Arenaza-Urquijo, 2011).


[CHUNK 6707]
Functional MRI (fMRI) permits simultaneous monitoring of
the activity of diﬀerent brain regions while a subject is at rest or
performing a task (Binder et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 6708]
In fMRI, oxygen in blood
is measured through blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
signals (Ogawa et al., 1990; Heeger and Ress, 2002). 

[CHUNK 6709]
Speciﬁcally,
the underlying premise is that more oxygen is required for
greater neuronal activity, thereby creating a signal that can be
detected using fMRI (Figure 1B). 

[CHUNK 6710]
Thus, it is possible to measure
changes in oxygen concentration, cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) and
volume (CBV) that are delayed by 1–2 s after MRI excitation.


[CHUNK 6711]
This is referred to as the hemodynamic response (Buxton et al.,
2004). 

[CHUNK 6712]
If the BOLD signal from diﬀerent areas of the brain show
similar and synchronized activity, it is assumed that these regions
communicate with each other and transfer information, which
is deﬁned as functional connectivity (Raichle, 1998).

connections, deﬁned as temporal correlations between spatially
distant cortical brain regions, are revealed through ﬂuctuations
in low-frequency portions of BOLD signals (Ogawa et al., 1990).


[CHUNK 6739]
With age, functional connectivity networks gradually decrease
(Dennis and Thompson, 2014), which may be important for
understanding early AD or the series of brain changes that
make the older brain more or less susceptible to additional
disease processes.


[CHUNK 6740]
Resting-state fMRI is an increasingly frequent method
employed to study diﬀerences between various cohorts and
involves the investigation of the activity of the brain while the
individual is at rest and not performing a task. 

[CHUNK 6741]
Resting-state fMRI
can be used to determine how diﬀerent brain regions operate and
process information in functional space. 

[CHUNK 6742]
Additional advantages
are that resting-state fMRI is less demanding on the individual
and easier to apply than task-related fMRI (Sheline and Raichle,
2013). 

[CHUNK 6743]
The individual is instructed to not fall asleep while keeping
their eyes closed in a lying position.


[CHUNK 6744]
There are a variety of approaches for analyzing resting-state
fMRI. 

[CHUNK 6745]
For instance, seed-based analysis (Beckmann et al., 2005)
investigates the BOLD signals between the selected region of
interest (seed region) and the rest of the brain (Biswal et al.,
1995). 

[CHUNK 6746]
In AD, the precuneus has showed decreased functional
connectivity to other brain regions, such as the left hippocampus,
left parahippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex and gyrus rectus,
as compared to non-dementia controls (Sheline and Raichle,
2013).

and is a wholly data-driven form of analysis (Beckmann et al.,
2005) (Figure 2). 

[CHUNK 6771]
Using ICA-based analysis, Greicius et al.


[CHUNK 6772]
(2004) reported a decline of resting-state functional connectivity
between hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in
the AD group compared to healthy older individuals.


[CHUNK 6773]
Another technique used to examine resting-state functional
connectivity is graph analysis, which employs a way of speciﬁcally
visualizing the complex interactions in the brain (Mijalkov
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6774]
Using graph theory, functional connectivity is
represented as a series of ‘nodes’ (voxels) and ‘edges’ (correlated
activity between nodes) (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; Stam et al.,
2007). 

[CHUNK 6775]
It has been predicted that small-world networks in
human fMRI studies with low-frequency oscillation might reveal
connectivity of the brain structure. 

[CHUNK 6776]
A speciﬁc focus of this form
of analysis in network organization is the average minimum
number of edges that must be traversed between any two nodes
in a brain network, referred to as ‘eﬀective path length.’ The
characteristics of small-world networks are clustering coeﬃcient,
high integration and their typical feature is shorter eﬀective path
length (Travers and Milgram, 1967; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010;
Kaminski and Blinowska, 2018). 

[CHUNK 6777]
Cluster coeﬃcient is described
as a measurement of nodes that are locally interconnected
(Kaminski and Blinowska, 2018). 

[CHUNK 6778]
This approach is particularly
useful when measuring and comparing diﬀerences in structural
and functional connectivity (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009), and
could be used to advance our understanding of the pathology of
neurodegenerative diseases (Figure 3A). 

[CHUNK 6779]
A further advantage of
graph theory analysis is that it makes no assumptions about how
close any two nodes are in space.


[CHUNK 6780]
CHANGES IN STRUCTURAL AND
FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN AD
Structural Connectivity
In AD, the loss of connections between neurons can result in
other structural alterations, such as atrophy, hypometabolism,
and NFT accumulation (Zhang et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 6781]
Signiﬁcant atrophy
in AD, identiﬁed through MRI, occurs in the posterior
hippocampus and the temporal and parietal cortices, which are
three of the structures that are involved in the default mode
network (DMN; Greicius et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 6782]
The default mode is a
network in the brain that is activated when individuals are not
engaged in a task, but are spontaneously thinking of past or future
events (Buckner et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 6783]
The DMN is a highly interconnected
set of cortical regions that demonstrate substantial correlated
activity, particularly when the attentional network is inactive
(Shulman et al., 1997; Buckner et al., 2008).


[CHUNK 6784]
Diﬀusion tensor imaging studies investigating white matter
changes in individuals with AD have demonstrated that the
disease causes a deterioration of white matter ﬁber bundles in
the MTL (Zhang et al., 2007), which may be present years
before overt episodic memory deﬁcits (Sexton et al., 2010),
impaired executive function (Reijmer et al., 2014), and other
symptoms of cognitive impairment (Zhang et al., 2007; Fischer
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6785]
Similarly, in an animal model, López-Gil et al.


[CHUNK 6786]
(2014) reported neuronal diﬀerences in structural networks
of chronically hypertensive rats before the manifestation of
disrupted executive functioning occurred, which may provide
insights into early stages of dementia. 

[CHUNK 6787]
Moreover, Grandjean
et al. 

[CHUNK 6788]
(2014) discovered reduced fractional anisotropy values
in transgenic mice with cerebral Aβ. 

[CHUNK 6789]
In cognitively healthy
individuals with elevated Aβ in the brain, potentially the
pathological correlate of early AD, structural changes appear
similar to individuals with MCI in terms of the topology
of structural network connectivity (Fischer et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 6790]
Interestingly, these individuals with high brain Aβ load despite
no overt cognitive symptomatology, demonstrated increased
shortest path length in white matter networks in the absence of
major neurodegenerative features such as atrophy or reduction
of cortical glucose (Fischer et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 6791]
Finally, the structural networks (or nodes) of individuals with
AD who possessed fewer connections (or edges) were more
susceptible to global disruption of white matter tracts than
individuals with more connections (Daianu et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6792]
In
addition, a rat transgenic model bearing mutant human amyloid
precursor protein (APP) and presenilin genes also demonstrated
a reduction of local and global eﬃciency, as well as less clustering
as compared to non-transgenic rats (Muñoz-Moreno et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 6793]
Moreover, Muñoz-Moreno et al. 

[CHUNK 6794]
(2018) found alterations in
the right medial PFC in these transgenic rats, while in human
studies, the right medial frontal cortical areas in AD indicated
a decline in nodal eﬃciency compared to healthy controls (Lo
et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 6795]
In summary, changes in structural connectivity could
be useful in predicting the degradation of white matter bundles,
as well as the strength of functional connectivity networks
(Greicius et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 6796]
Functional Connectivity
Performance within many domains of cognitive function
decreases slowly with age, but, importantly, higher cognitive
performance has been correlated with increased functional
connectivity in older adults (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 6797]
Compared to animal studies, transgenic AD rat models require
longer cognitive training to achieve the same performance
as non-transgenic rats. 

[CHUNK 6798]
Although the structural network was
changed, these alteration did not result in functional network
diﬀerences proposing associations between the capability to
learn and the reorganization of functional networks in the

Pietzuch et al.


[CHUNK 6802]
Resting-State Networks in Alzheimer’s Disease
brain (Muñoz-Moreno et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 6803]
Nevertheless, a gradual
decrease in functional connectivity among the hippocampus
and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) is expected with age
(Damoiseaux et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 6804]
It has been proposed that disconnection of functional
networks in the brain, such as those observed in AD, could
serve as critical markers for the presence of early stages
of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly with regard to the
abnormal accumulation of Aβ in the brain (Stam et al., 2007;
Zhang and Raichle, 2010). 

[CHUNK 6805]
Resting-state studies have reported a
decrease in functional connectivity in healthy older individuals
with Aβ burden in the posteromedial regions, ventral medial
PFC, right angular gyrus, and the left middle and superior frontal
gyri (Mormino et al., 2011), as well as between the precuneus
and left hippocampus, parahippocampus, anterior cingulate,
gyrus rectus and dorsal cingulate (Sheline et al., 2010a,b). 

[CHUNK 6806]
Early
accumulation of Aβ in older healthy individuals, particularly
in the precuneus, has been suggested to result in impairment
in hippocampal function (Sheline et al., 2010a,b). 

[CHUNK 6807]
In contrast,
Mormino et al. 

[CHUNK 6808]
(2011) reported that DMN connectivity responds
in a varied manner to the presence of higher Aβ deposition in
older non-demented people with Aβ accumulation. 

[CHUNK 6809]
Speciﬁcally,
the authors found that there was increased connectivity in
regions of the right dorsal PFC, left anterior medial PFC and
left temporal cortices, as well as decreased DMN connectivity
in several posteromedial regions, the ventral medial PFC, right
angular gyrus, and the left frontal gyri (Mormino et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 6810]
Disruption within the DMN has also been found in healthy older
individuals with high amyloid burden (Hedden et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 6811]
Interestingly, these healthy individuals (n = 38) exhibited the
same amount of Aβ burden compared to half of the individuals
with MCI (n = 46) and all individuals with AD (n = 35).


[CHUNK 6812]
Such associations have also been investigated in animal
models. 

[CHUNK 6813]
Bero et al. 

[CHUNK 6814]
(2012) demonstrated an aging-related
reduction of bilateral functional connectivity in the retrosplenial
cortex in wild-type mice, which could be a pre-existing biomarker
for neural dysfunction due to its signiﬁcant association with
memory performance (Corcoran et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 6815]
Interestingly, in
transgenic AD mouse model involving cortical amyloidosis,
it has been shown that an age-related decrease in functional
connectivity in speciﬁc brain regions is more severe in the
presence of higher Aβ deposition (Bero et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 6816]
Grandjean
et al. 

[CHUNK 6817]
(2014) also reported reduced functional connectivity in
transgenic mice, however, this reduction appeared in the early
months before the accumulation of Aβ in the somatosensory
and motor cortex.


[CHUNK 6818]
A
study
investigating
whole-brain
connectivity
found
abnormalities in cortical hubs of the temporo-parietal cortex and
precuneus/PCC in healthy mild cognitive impaired subjects with
Aβ burden (Drzezga et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 6819]
In general, greater atrophy has
been related to less brain connectivity (Hoﬀstaedter et al., 2015),
but not all studies have found support for this association. 

[CHUNK 6820]
For
example, a study by Gili et al. 

[CHUNK 6821]
(2011), reported that functional
connectivity decline was not related to the amount of gray matter
atrophy in the PCC in individual with MCI.


[CHUNK 6822]
Disconnection between functional networks could be an
essential biomarker for AD. 

[CHUNK 6823]
For instance, individuals with AD
exhibit disruption of functional connectivity between the inferior
lateral temporal cortex (ITC), precuneus, right thalamus and the
PCC (Zhang et al., 2009), between the left hippocampus and PCC
(Sorg et al., 2007), as well as between the right hippocampus
and the right and left cuneus, precuneus, and right ITC (Wang
et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 6824]
This pattern of disconnection is likely associated
with impairments in memory, processing speed and executive
function (Damoiseaux et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6825]
Another proposed early
biomarker for AD could lie in the disruptions that have been
identiﬁed within the visual cortices, speciﬁcally the impairments
in connectivity between the PCC and the dorsal and ventral visual
pathways (Zhang et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 6826]
These changes have been suggested
to lead to deteriorating visual function in AD (Zhang et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 6827]
Small-world network analysis in AD has shown longer path
length in the central, temporal, and frontal brain regions as
compared to age-matched, non-demented individuals (Stam
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 6828]
Decreased local connectedness within networks,
also called clustering, has also been reported in individuals with
AD, and correlated with lower cognitive performance (Stam
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 6829]
This ﬁnding led Stam et al. 

[CHUNK 6830]
(2007) to speculate
that individuals in the early stages of AD may show relatively
diminished topology of small-world networks. 

[CHUNK 6831]
A recent study
found support for this notion by demonstrating that individuals
with MCI and AD had a longer characteristic path length
compared to healthy controls (Mijalkov et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6832]
Moreover,
AD appeared to be associated with a greater number of edges
connecting to a node regionally, as well as increases and decreases
in the eﬃciency of local nodes when compared to the controls
(Mijalkov et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6833]
To understand these diﬀerences in
network topology, it is necessary to account for genetic variations
that might aﬀect the organization of the brain and which may also
be linked to neurodegeneration in AD (Figure 3A).


[CHUNK 6834]
ROLE OF GENETIC FACTORS RELATED
TO AD IN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY
Apolipoprotein E (APOE)
The inheritance of gene-related factors such as apolipoprotein
E (APOE), in particular the APOE ε4 allele, is associated with
an increased risk of AD (Mahley et al., 2006, This genetic
polymorphism is associated with increased Aβ deposition in
the brain (Mahley et al., 2009; Morris et al., 2010; Sheline
et al., 2010a), possibly inﬂuencing brain functional connectivity
(Mahley et al., 2009), as well as aﬀecting cognitive functioning in
older age (Wisdom et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 6835]
Resting-state
fMRI
studies
have
reported
diverging
associations of APOE polymorphisms and functional con-
nectivity in healthy individuals that may relate to the age
of the sample groups (Goveas et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 6836]
For example, APOE ε4 alleles have been associated with both
increased and decreased DMN functional connectivity in
cognitively healthy individuals (Fleisher et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 6837]
Comparing
non-demented middle-aged (50–65 years) individuals carrying
the APOEε4 with non-carriers, ε4 carriers showed elevated
functional connectivity in the middle frontal gyrus, whilst non-ε4
carriers had greater functional connectivity in the right medial

frontal gyrus (Wu et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6845]
Conversely, Goveas et al. 

[CHUNK 6846]
(2013),
demonstrated decreased functional connectivity within the DMN
in cognitively healthy APOE ε4 carriers (44–65 years of age) in
the bilateral dorsomedial PFC, superior frontal gyri, and in the
left hippocampus, as well as increased functional connectivity
in the left lentiform nucleus and bilateral caudate. 

[CHUNK 6847]
Additionally,
a decrease in interhemispheric functional connectivity within
the DMN was found in healthy elderly APOEε4 carriers (65–80
years of age; Lu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6848]
Notably, most of these regions
are also aﬀected in AD, which emphasizes the signiﬁcance
of the involvement of the DMN in the preclinical phase of
AD (Sheline et al., 2010a). 

[CHUNK 6849]
More recently, Zheng et al. 

[CHUNK 6850]
(2018)
investigated functional connectivity in young adults who were
APPs/presenilin-1/2 mutation carriers or APOEε4 positive
carriers relative to adults without these AD-linked genetic factors
(18–35 years). 

[CHUNK 6851]
Interestingly, greater functional connectivity was
observed in both the APOEε4 carriers and in the APP/presenilin-
1/2 group as compared to healthy controls. 

[CHUNK 6852]
This increased
connectivity was found between the left hippocampus and the
bilateral medial PFC/precuneus. 

[CHUNK 6853]
Only APOEε4 carriers displayed
increased connectivity between the right hippocampus and the
left middle temporal gyrus. 

[CHUNK 6854]
Here, the authors have suggested that
the ‘beneﬁcial’ eﬀect of APOE ε4 in functional connectivity in
younger individuals may be due to mechanisms of compensation
of cognitive disruptions, which may be detrimental as the
individual ages.


[CHUNK 6855]
Due to inconsistencies in published evidence, it is important
to consider how APOE polymorphisms may be associated
with other measures of functional connectivity. 

[CHUNK 6856]
Studies that
have investigated APOE eﬀects in small-world networks have
reported higher susceptibility of fewer functional hubs and
reduced centrality in healthy older ε4 carriers compared to
non-ε4 carriers (Seo et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 6857]
Regional cerebral glucose
metabolism, clustering of whole-brain functional networks, and
path length have all been reported to be decreased in ε4 carriers
(Seo et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 6858]
However, in a study with a greater sample
size of 147 cognitively normal individuals, more clustering and
longer path lengths were identiﬁed in ε4 carriers when compared
to non-carriers (Goryawala et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6859]
Non-demented ε4-
carriers also had more long-distance connections in the parietal
and temporal lobes, whilst non-ε4 carriers exhibited more
short-distance connections in the parietal and occipital lobe.


[CHUNK 6860]
Healthy older individuals with the ε4 allele also had less short-
distance connections in the frontal lobe connections, while both
groups showed more long-distance connections in the frontal
lobe (Goryawala et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6861]
In summary, this study found the
brain networks of those carrying APOEε4 to be organized into an
abnormal structure when compared to non-carriers, with fewer
connections in the frontal lobe and more structural long length
connections, which could partially explain the negative APOE ε4
cognitive phenotype.


[CHUNK 6862]
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
(BDNF)
Another genetic factor related to AD is the BDNF gene (Brown
et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 6863]
The BDNF protein belongs to the family of nerve
growth factors, which aﬀect neurogenesis (Erickson et al., 2010)
as well as long-term potentiation (LTP) and activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity (Egan et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 6864]
Post-mortem studies of
AD have shown that BDNF protein levels are decreased in the
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, temporal, frontal, and parietal
cortex when compared to cognitively intact age-matched controls
(Connor et al., 1997; Garzon et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 6865]
Lower BDNF levels
may be related to volume loss in the hippocampus (Erickson
et al., 2010), but this may be secondary to other pathological
changes that occur in AD (Buchman et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6866]
BDNF
concentration is highly variable between individuals and is
relative to physiological state; for example, after physical exercise,

Pietzuch et al.


[CHUNK 6868]
Resting-State Networks in Alzheimer’s Disease
peripheral blood BDNF concentration is increased (Dinoﬀet al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 6869]
A recent review supported this ﬁnding by reporting
increased neurogenesis and plasticity in the hippocampus in rats
and mice after treadmill exercise, which led to improved short-
and long-term memory functions (Jahangiri et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 6870]
A common single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF
gene, speciﬁcally a valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 66
(Val66Met), has an inﬂuence on LTP as well as activity-dependent
BDNF secretion (Egan et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 6871]
BDNF Val66Met has been
associated with cognitive performance as well as with AD brain
morphology. 

[CHUNK 6872]
In particular, the BDNF Met gene carriers (aged 60
and older), which were in preclinical stages of AD, demonstrated
reduced memory function and smaller hippocampal and
temporal lobe volume as compared to Val homozygotes (Lim
et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 6873]
Authors also observed that more
physical exercise was related to larger hippocampal and temporal
lobe volumes in Val homozygotes but not in Met carriers (Brown
et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 6874]
Notably, in Met carriers, physical activity was linked
to reduced volumes of the temporal lobe, which is likely due to
more apoptotic alterations (Brown et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 6875]
Likewise, Egan
et al. 

[CHUNK 6876]
(2003) demonstrated that the BDNF Met allele is related
to qualitative changes of the hippocampus, which might cause
insuﬃcient memory functioning. 

[CHUNK 6877]
Studies have proposed that
there might be a relationship between Aβ and BDNF Val66Met,
in which the BDNF polymorphism might mediate the eﬀects
on Aβ neurotoxicity on the brain (Fahnestock, 2011). 

[CHUNK 6878]
Lim et al.


[CHUNK 6879]
(2013) reported not only a faster rate of atrophy in hippocampal
volume, but also a faster decline in episodic memory performance
in BDNF Met carriers who had a high Aβ load over a 36-month
period compared to healthy individuals with BDNF Met but low
levels of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 6880]
Relative to Val homozygotes with a low Aβ load,
Val homozygotes with a high Aβ load also experienced reduced
cognitive performance, indicating that being a Val homozygote
would
not
necessary
protect
against
cognitive
decline
(Lim et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 6881]
In older adults with late-onset depression, BDNF Met carriage
was associated with reduced resting-state functional connectivity
between the bilateral hippocampus and cerebellum (Yin et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 6882]
BDNF Met carriers with late-onset depression also had
reduced strong (positive) functional connectivity between the
hippocampus and the temporal cortex; however, there was
also evidence of increased anti-correlated (negative) functional
connectivity between the hippocampus and the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex, dorsal-lateral PFC, and angular gyrus (Yin
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6883]
Similarly, Wang et al. 

[CHUNK 6884]
(2014) observed elevated
functional connectivity between the dorsal lateral PFC and
the anterior insula in cognitively healthy BDNF Met carriers.


[CHUNK 6885]
Finally, Park et al. 

[CHUNK 6886]
(2017) investigated the inﬂuence of BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism on structural networks of middle-
aged healthy individuals. 

[CHUNK 6887]
The authors targeted nodes and edges
in their analysis and simulated manipulation of the white
matter networks. 

[CHUNK 6888]
They demonstrated that Val homozygotes
were more robust and resistant to gray matter damage
compared to Met carriers (Park et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6889]
Studies of white
matter networks determined that BDNF Met carriers were
more susceptible to node disruptions than Val homozygotes
(Park et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 6890]
The
interaction
of
the
BDNF
Met
and
APOEε4
polymorphisms was investigated by Gomar et al. 

[CHUNK 6891]
(2016) in
healthy older adults, as well as in individuals with MCI and
AD. 

[CHUNK 6892]
Here, the authors found that BDNF Met alleles were
associated with poorer cognitive performance, predominantly
in memory and semantic ﬂuency. 

[CHUNK 6893]
In support, Ward et al. 

[CHUNK 6894]
(2014)
found decreased performance in episodic memory function
in BDNF Met carriers, however, only in combination with
carriage of the APOE ε4 allele, the latter perhaps representing a
cumulative eﬀect of carriage of both risk alleles. 

[CHUNK 6895]
This cumulative
eﬀect may be inﬂuencing the functional brain networks
and
reduce
connections
between
diﬀerent
brain
regions.


[CHUNK 6896]
BDNF Met carriers may have fewer connections compared
to BDNF Val homozygotes (Figure 3B) and APOE ε4/BDNF
Met carriers may have even fewer connections compared to
non ε4/BDNF Val homozygote carriers, which may decrease
connectivity (Figure 3C).


[CHUNK 6897]
In a separate study, BDNF Met/APOEε4 carriers with high
brain Aβ levels demonstrated a faster rate of decline over a 54-
month period in verbal and visual episodic memory and language
processing when compared to BDNF Met/non-APOE ε4 carriers
(Lim et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6898]
In comparison, BDNF Val/ε4 carriers with
a high Aβ burden demonstrated a relatively mild reduction in
cognitive functioning. 

[CHUNK 6899]
In BDNF Met/APOEε4 carriers with high
Aβ load, memory deﬁcits are detectable after 3 years, whereas it
takes 10 years in APOEε4-/BDNF Val homozygotes with a high
Aβ load to reach the same clinical threshold (Lim et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 6900]
A recent meta-analysis investigated the relationship between
APOE and BDNF Val66Met and concluded that there were
more women with AD carrying the BDNF Met polymorphism
(Zhao et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 6901]
However, no signiﬁcant relationships between
APOEε4 carriers and BDNF Met carriers were identiﬁed in the
overall analysis that included both men and women with AD.


[CHUNK 6902]
APOE and BDNF polymorphisms may interact with each
other and possibly inﬂuence functional connectivity. 

[CHUNK 6903]
BDNF Met
carriers with the APOE ε4 allele exhibited decreased brain
activation in the MTL (Kauppi et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 6904]
Atrophy, particularly
in the entorhinal cortex, and acceleration of AD pathology, has
been linked to poor compensation mechanisms of the brain
in individuals with BDNF Met carrying the APOEε4 (Gomar
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6905]
Ward et al. 

[CHUNK 6906]
(2015b) investigated the eﬀect of BDNF
and APOE on cognitive function and cognitive reserve, the
latter which is a theoretical construct where neural networks
compensate for lost neurons and connections (Stern, 2002).


[CHUNK 6907]
The authors observed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism,
but not APOE variants, moderated the relationship between
executive function and cognitive reserve, in which exposure to
a more cognitively enriched environment was associated with
better executive functioning in Val homozygotes but not in Met
carriers (Ward et al., 2015a). 

[CHUNK 6908]
In another study, Ward et al.


[CHUNK 6909]
(2017) investigated the same healthy older adult sample and
found that diﬀerences in executive functioning between cognitive
reserve tertile groups became smaller over time in BDNF Val
homozygotes, but cognitive reserve-related diﬀerences became
more pronounced in BDNF Met carriers. 

[CHUNK 6910]
An explanation for
these results is that cognitive reserve could have varying cognitive
eﬀects depending on the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (Ward

[CHUNK 6912]
Resting-State Networks in Alzheimer’s Disease
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6913]
Altogether, experimental studies indicate that the
BDNF polymorphism inﬂuences key neurobiological processes
associated with development and activity-dependent learning
(Egan et al., 2003).


[CHUNK 6914]
COGNITIVE RESERVE AND BRAIN
CONNECTIVITY
It is possible that common variation in the BDNF gene may
result in diﬀerences in the development and maintenance of
structural and functional networks throughout the life course,
which ultimately may be associated with either better or worse
brain resilience to neurodegenerative disease processes, such as
in AD. 

[CHUNK 6915]
Given the role of BDNF in development and adult brain
plasticity, it is also possible that this gene variation may have
an inﬂuence on the construction of patterns of connectivity
that underlie resistance to pathology, perhaps related to the
theoretical construct of cognitive reserve (Stern, 2002, 2006), in
which neurons are compensating for impaired and lost neurons.


[CHUNK 6916]
Stern
(2002,
2009)
proposed
two
diﬀerent
kinds
of
reserve in relation to a brain challenged by insult and/or
neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 6917]
Brain or neural reserve, which is often
referred to as the ‘passive’ model of reserve, focuses on
anatomical brain structures, especially brain size and the number
and architecture of neurons and synapses (Katzman, 1993). 

[CHUNK 6918]
This
model, later revised by Satz (1993), proposed that individuals
with higher synaptic count, dendritic branching and larger brain
volume should be able to withstand the loss of more neurons
without
functional
consequence,
providing
compensation
for the pathological changes of AD (Stern, 2009). 

[CHUNK 6919]
The brain
reserve model suggests that most of its capacity is established
in the early years of life, usually by the age of ﬁve (Reiss et al.,
1996). 

[CHUNK 6920]
Nevertheless, investigations have demonstrated that
brain reserve may be modiﬁable. 

[CHUNK 6921]
For example, the brains of
adult monkeys are able to form and renew cells throughout
life (Eriksson et al., 1998), and human brains have also been
proposed to have neurogenic capacity, particularly in the dentate
gyrus (Kempermann et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 6922]
The ‘active’ model of reserve is often referred to as ‘cognitive
reserve,’ which is a hypothetical construct that relates to
the functional resilience of the brain against accumulating
pathological changes (Stern et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 6923]
According to the
theory of cognitive reserve, brains with more complex neural
networks have a higher level of inbuilt redundancy, which
are subsequently able to compensate for degenerative or lost
neurons (Stern, 2002, 2006). 

[CHUNK 6924]
Factors such as lifetime experience,
educational and occupational attainment, and socioeconomic
status are posited to play a signiﬁcant role in the development
of cognitive reserve (Stern, 2009, 2012). 

[CHUNK 6925]
For example, individuals
with AD and higher cognitive reserve (education levels) had
greater DMN connectivity compared to individuals with AD
and lower education levels (Bozzali et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6926]
Bastin et al.


[CHUNK 6927]
(2012) on the other hand, determined that there was more
cerebral pathology and reduced activity of metabolism in
the temporoparietal cortex in healthy individuals with higher
education. 

[CHUNK 6928]
Furthermore, although Brayne et al. 

[CHUNK 6929]
(2010) found that
the amount of accumulation of pathological burden in the brain
was not aﬀected by the number of years of education that an
individual had completed, higher levels of educational attainment
was found to be associated with a lower risk of demonstrating
dementia on the background of the burden of pathology.


[CHUNK 6930]
Lifelong engagement in cognitively stimulating activities may
reduce the risk of developing dementia by 40% (Scarmeas and
Stern, 2003; Valenzuela et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 6931]
In support, Jahangiri et al.


[CHUNK 6932]
(2018) noted that exercise was associated with improved memory
function, as well as reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative
disease in diﬀerent animal models. 

[CHUNK 6933]
In human studies, Larsson
et al. 

[CHUNK 6934]
(2017) reported that individuals with higher educational
attainment had a lower risk of developing AD. 

[CHUNK 6935]
Similarly,
in healthy participants (50–79 years), education later in life
(university study for at least 12 months) was positively associated
with cognitive reserve (as estimated by current psychological
assessment scores) compared to those who did not complete any
further university education (Lenehan et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6936]
Associations
between education and age are evident particularly in the
attention and speed processing domains (Perry et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 6937]
In
line with these ﬁndings, Summers et al. 

[CHUNK 6938]
(2017) found that 92.5%
of individuals 50 years and older who had attended university
for at least 12 months showed increased cognitive performance
in domains that may be a proxy for cognitive reserve.


[CHUNK 6939]
Stern (2009) hypothesized that individuals with AD who have
higher cognitive reserve possess more ﬂexible neural networks
and will retain a higher level of cognitive performance with
an increasing neuropathological load. 

[CHUNK 6940]
This notion of neural
ﬂexibility could potentially be demonstrated in re-organizable
functional networks of the brain observed in cognitively healthy
individuals (Bosch et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 6941]
In this study of healthy
older individuals, higher cognitive reserve was associated with
increased brain activity in the DMN, but it was also associated
with decreased brain activity in regions associated with speech
comprehension. 

[CHUNK 6942]
In contrast, in individuals with MCI or AD,
decreased activation in the DMN and more activation in language
processing in subjects was associated with higher cognitive
reserve (Bosch et al., 2010).


[CHUNK 6943]
Education and cognitive reserve have a positive eﬀect on
functional connectivity networks (Marques et al., 2016) and
cognitive functioning (Bozzali et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6944]
There is evidence
that high cognitive reserve levels were related to working
memory, while age had a negative eﬀect on cognition (Ward
et al., 2015a). 

[CHUNK 6945]
High cognitive reserve has been associated with
greater functional connectivity in healthy elderly individuals
(Marques et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6946]
Arenaza-Urquijo et al. 

[CHUNK 6947]
(2013) examined a
cognitively healthy older population (60–80 years) and described
better brain metabolism, higher gray matter volume as well as
enhanced functional connectivity in individuals who had more
years of early-life formal education. 

[CHUNK 6948]
In particular, the authors
found higher functional connectivity in regions such as the
anterior cingulate cortex, right hippocampus, right PCC, left
inferior frontal lobe and left angular gyrus in people with those
with more education.


[CHUNK 6949]
Marques et al. 

[CHUNK 6950]
(2015) likewise examined the relationship
between education and functional connectivity and found
that individuals with more education had larger networks.

[CHUNK 6953]
Resting-State Networks in Alzheimer’s Disease
These enlarged networks were connected to all lobes in each
hemisphere and inﬂuenced functional connections in a positive
way, which was predicted to moderate the eﬀects of age on
brain connectivity (Marques et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 6954]
Moreover, Marques
et al. 

[CHUNK 6955]
(2016) investigated whether sex and the number of years of
education [used as demographic characteristics (DEM)], in 120
healthy older individuals inﬂuenced functional networks in the
brain. 

[CHUNK 6956]
The authors demonstrated that the DEM had a positive
eﬀect locally (in the neighborhood areas), on the strength of
nodes, eﬃciency and on clustering coeﬃcient, exhibiting greater
communication within the networks of the occipital and parietal
lobe areas. 

[CHUNK 6957]
There was also a relationship found between the DEM
and network transitivity indicating that individuals with more
education use diﬀerent neural processing (Marques et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 6958]
Network transitivity is deﬁned as the connection between two
nodes that are linked to each other via an edge in a network.


[CHUNK 6959]
In addition, Marques et al. 

[CHUNK 6960]
(2016) examined how cognitive
reserve measured by educational attainment aﬀected functional
connectivity in resting state fMRI. 

[CHUNK 6961]
They demonstrated that
larger networks with more functional connections in the brain
were related to higher cognitive reserve. 

[CHUNK 6962]
Greater local eﬃciency
and higher local clustering in the cuneus, as well as in the
areas of the superior and middle occipital lobe were related to
higher levels of cognitive reserve (Marques et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6963]
The
inferior temporal gyrus is predicted to have a signiﬁcant role
for cognitive reserve, because of its betweenness centrality and
nodal strength, which demonstrated a positive correlation with
cognitive reserve. 

[CHUNK 6964]
The fraction of all shortest paths in the network
that pass through a given node is called betweenness centrality
(Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). 

[CHUNK 6965]
The inferior temporal gyrus is a
signiﬁcant hub responsible for recognition and visualization of
words and numbers (Grotheer et al., 2016), which are important
functions involved in cognitive reserve networks (Marques et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 6966]
Finally, global eﬃciency, which is “a measure of functional
integration” (Marques et al., 2016), was greater in individuals
displaying higher cognitive reserve compared to individuals with
lesser cognitive reserve.


[CHUNK 6967]
Colangeli et al. 

[CHUNK 6968]
(2016) conducted a meta-analysis of whether
functional brain networks were associated with cognitive reserve
in healthy older adults, as well as in amnestic MCI (aMCI)
and AD. 

[CHUNK 6969]
Findings in all subgroups showed greater functional
brain activation in the anterior cingulate in the left hemisphere
while performing a cognitively stimulating task (e.g., recognition
memory task). 

[CHUNK 6970]
However, the cognitively healthy older adult
group demonstrated greater activation in several brain regions
as compared to the aMCI and AD groups. 

[CHUNK 6971]
These activated brain
regions included the left anterior cingulate and left precuneus, the
right cingulate gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus of the dorso-
lateral PFC, all of which are susceptible to degenerative changes in
individuals diagnosed with AD and aMCI (Colangeli et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 6972]
Bozzali et al. 

[CHUNK 6973]
(2015) investigated whether cognitive reserve
modiﬁes
resting-state
functional
connectivity
in
healthy,
aMCI, and AD individuals (mean age 74.6 years). 

[CHUNK 6974]
Functional
connectivity was associated with the cognitive reserve proxy,
education, within the DMN. 

[CHUNK 6975]
Higher functional connectivity
within the PCC was associated with higher education in
individuals with AD, in which education possibly initiated
mechanism of compensation. 

[CHUNK 6976]
Education may also have led to
brain plasticity and supported the PCC from atrophying. 

[CHUNK 6977]
Some
of the aMCI group exhibited similar connectivity strength,
however, there was no strong functional connectivity found in
the healthy group (Bozzali et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 6978]
Franzmeier et al. 

[CHUNK 6979]
(2016) also demonstrated that higher global
functional connectivity was present in individuals with MCI
with relatively higher levels of education. 

[CHUNK 6980]
Individuals with more
years of education and prodromal AD were able to compensate
for ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET hypometabolism in the
precuneus and had greater connectivity in the left frontal lobe,
as well as better performance in memory (Franzmeier et al.,
2017a,b). 

[CHUNK 6981]
Moreover, Franzmeier et al. 

[CHUNK 6982]
(2017b) demonstrated that
individuals with MCI who had higher educational attainment
and high Aβ levels had a more global left frontal cortex
connectivity when controlled for age and sex, whereas, in
healthy individuals, global left frontal cortex connectivity was not
related with metabolism in the precuneus. 

[CHUNK 6983]
Negative connectivity
between the left lateral frontal cortex and the DMN was also
found in people with MCI who had achieved higher education
(Franzmeier et al., 2017a). 

[CHUNK 6984]
Perry et al. 

[CHUNK 6985]
(2017) demonstrated a
positive correlation between years of education and cognitive
functioning (e.g., visuospatial, executive function, language) but
a weak relationship between education and brain networks,
especially when the brain already showed evidence of age-related
changes in healthy individuals. 

[CHUNK 6986]
The greatest impact in age-
related alterations later in life was found in the sensorimotor
networks, especially those underlying processing speed and
attention (Perry et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 6987]
In summary, education early in life and other life-long
cognitively stimulating activities could be possible protectors
against neurodegenerative diseases, and might bolster cognitive
reserve later in life (Ward et al., 2015b).


[CHUNK 6988]
CONCLUSION
The brain is a large set of complex networks that are
connected structurally and functionally. 

[CHUNK 6989]
Diﬀerent areas of
the brain share and communicate information in functional
space, creating networks. 

[CHUNK 6990]
These networks can be adversely
or positively inﬂuenced by various genetic and environmental
factors. 

[CHUNK 6991]
For instance, studies reported that APOE ε4 was
associated with decreased functional connectivity (Lu et al.,
2017) and longer path length in functional networks (Goryawala

However, there was also decreased path length
(Seo et al., 2013) and increased functional connectivity found
in healthy APOE ε4 carriers (Wu et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6993]
Similarly,
healthy older BDNF Met carriers were associated with reduced
functional connectivity, while Val homozygotes showed a
more robust network in the brain structure (Park et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 6994]
Cognitive activities and environmental enrichment
have favorable eﬀects on BDNF Val homozygotes, and over
time
also
on
BDNF
Met
carriers
(Ward
et
al.,
2017),
which possibly may promote maintaining healthy cognitive
functioning and reduce the detrimental eﬀects progressing
age.

Resting-State Networks in Alzheimer’s Disease
and cognitive reserve are associated with an increase of
functional
connectivity
in
the
brain
networks
(Marques
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 6998]
This could potentially aﬀect brain networks
in a positive way and may mitigate and protect against
cognitive impairments later in life, and hopefully delay or
even prevent the onset of AD (Prince et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 6999]
Future
studies
should
investigate
whether
cognitive
reserve
and
environmental enrichment work as compensatory mechanisms
to inﬂuence and alter the networks of more susceptible genetic
polymorphisms to AD, such as APOE ε4 and BDNF Met
carriers. 

[CHUNK 7000]
Education later in life increases cognitive reserve
and could provide more resistance and resilience to brain
pathology. 

[CHUNK 7001]
Overall, these ﬁndings indicate that the functional
networks of the brain are inﬂuenced by a combination of
genetic and environmental factors. 

[CHUNK 7002]
An improved understanding
of these relationships is vital in order to fully grasp how
neurodegenerative changes aﬀect brain function, but also to
determine how cognitive resilience to neurodegenerative changes
may be promoted.

Aberrations in brain microcirculation and the associated increase in blood-brain-barrier
(BBB) permeability in addition to neuroinﬂammation and Aβ deposition observed in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and ischemia have gained considerable attention recently.


[CHUNK 7749]
However, the role of microvascular homeostasis as a pathogenic substrate to disturbed
microperfusion as well as an overlapping etiologic mechanism between AD and ischemia
has not been thoroughly explored. 

[CHUNK 7750]
In this study, we employ temporal histopathology
of cerebral vasculature in a rat model of β-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and endothelin-1
induced-ischemia (ET1) to investigate the panorama of cerebral pathology and the
protein expression on d1, d7, and d28 post-injury. 

[CHUNK 7751]
The combination of Aβ and ET1
pathological states leads to an alteration in microvascular anatomy, texture, diameter,
density, and protein expression, in addition to disturbed vessel-matrix-connections,
inter-compartmental water exchange and basement membrane proﬁle within the lesion
epicenter localized in the striatum of Aβ+ET1 brains compared to Aβ and ET1 rats.


[CHUNK 7752]
We conclude that the neural microvascular network, in addition to the neural tissue,
is not only sensitive to structural deterioration but also serves as an underlying
vascular etiology between ischemia and AD pathologies. 

[CHUNK 7753]
Such investigation can provide
prospects to appreciate the interrelationships between structure and responses of
cerebral microvasculature and to provide a venue for vascular remodeling as a new
treatment strategy.

INTRODUCTION
In general, the microvascular bed of the brain is considered functionally adynamic and less sensitive
to the morphological injuries than the neurons they serve and their supportive cells (del Zoppo
et al., 2000), due to the comparative resistance of brain endothelium to hypoxia, to a certain extent
(Tagaya et al., 1997).

Cerebral Injury and Vascular Defects
(arterioles) – eﬀerent (venules) connections] are either the target
or consequence of numerous insults such as focal ischemia (del
Zoppo et al., 2000), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Ujiie et al.,
2003), vascular dementia (Parnetti et al., 1994), hypertensive
angiopathy
(Baumbach
and
Heistad,
1989),
autoimmune
vasculitides,
hyperglycemia,
and
inﬂammatory
disorders
(Paul et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 7759]
Chronic hydrocephalus, in particular,
is associated with reduced cerebral blood ﬂow and direct
compression of ﬁbers, blood vessels or brain tissue [reviewed in
Owler and Pickard (2001)].


[CHUNK 7760]
Consequential
footprints
of
vascular
defects
are
BBB
breakdown, leakage of blood-borne molecules, swelling of
astrocytic endfeet, interruption of inter-compartmental ﬂuid
exchange, disruption of basement membrane (BM), vessel-
matrix-connections (Bailey et al., 2004), and disturbed capillary
physiology (Paul et al., 2007; Brown and Thore, 2011) that
leads to altered brain microcirculation [reviewed in Amtul
and Hepburn (2014)]. 

[CHUNK 7761]
Vascular functional defects have been
described in AD transgenic animal models (Ujiie et al., 2003) and
patients (Farrall and Wardlaw, 2009). 

[CHUNK 7762]
For instance, vaccination
against β-amyloid (Aβ); the hallmark of the AD, has been
shown to reverse BBB pathology (Dickstein, 2006). 

[CHUNK 7763]
Similarly,
BBB breakdown due to the dissolution of primary endothelial
cell permeability barrier and resulting hypoperfusion is also
an antecedent event to cerebral ischemia (Hawkins, 2005).


[CHUNK 7764]
Intriguingly, there is a great majority of patients with ﬁrst-ever
stroke, who developed post-stroke dementia (Pendlebury and
Rothwell, 2009), establishing that ischemic and AD pathogeneses
interact with each other.


[CHUNK 7765]
In this regard, we have demonstrated some very key
pathological
changes
in
the
combined
animal
model
of
Aβ
toxicity
and
ischemia,
such
as
lateral-ventricle
enlargement,
neuroinﬂammation,
Aβ
deposition,
altered
insulin signaling/BBB, hippocampal injury, and impairment
in learning and memory (Amtul and Hepburn, 2014; Amtul
et al., 2011a,b, 2014, 2018a,c; Yang et al., 2014; Amtul, 2016,
2018). 

[CHUNK 7766]
Using sequential computed tomography (CT) imaging
we have also established altered microperfusion and associated
elevated BBB disruption in the comorbid model of Aβ toxicity
and ischemia (Yang et al., 2014; Amtul et al., 2018d). 

[CHUNK 7767]
Surprisingly
little is known about the eﬀect of comorbid injury on the
anatomical
alteration
of
cerebrovasculature,
topographic
distribution, density, diameter and their role in maintaining
cerebral water homeostasis and vessel-matrix-connections. 

[CHUNK 7768]
Due
to the serious consequences; damage to cerebral vasculature
homeostasis and thus function must be considered a critical
contributing component in the development of neurological
disorders. 

[CHUNK 7769]
Moreover, analyzing the vascular anatomical defects
is also essential for adequate interpretation of brain imaging
data to take us one step closer to develop remedies to restore
vascular architecture, which may emerge as a new therapeutic
target. 

[CHUNK 7770]
Therefore, our working hypothesis is that the alteration
in microvascular anatomy, texture, diameter, density, protein
expression, and function serve as the interrelated pathogenic and
etiologic link between AD and ischemia. 

[CHUNK 7771]
Therefore, in the present
study, we studied the anatomy of striatal microvasculature and
the associated eﬀects on water exchange and vascular-matrix
connections by investigating various vascular markers at diﬀerent
time points in a comorbid rat model of Aβ toxicity and ischemia.


[CHUNK 7772]
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Animal Treatment
All of the animal experiments were conducted in full compliance
with the guidelines and approval of the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Western University (approval ID: 2008-113).


[CHUNK 7773]
All possible steps were taken to reduce the number of animals
and their discomfort level. 

[CHUNK 7774]
Two- to three-month old male Albino
Wistar rats (Charles River Canada) weighing 250 to 310 g
at the beginning of the experiment were used. 

[CHUNK 7775]
Animals were
divided into four groups for three diﬀerent (d1, d7, and d28)
timelines (n = 4 for each group). 

[CHUNK 7776]
For stereotactic surgery, the
animals were positioned into David Kopf stereotaxic apparatus
(David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, United States) and
anesthetized using 1.8% isoﬂurane. 

[CHUNK 7777]
Body temperatures were
maintained at 37◦C throughout the surgery with the help of a
heated blanket. 

[CHUNK 7778]
To insert 30 gauge Hamilton needle, three burr
holes were drilled in the parietal bone of each rat. 

[CHUNK 7779]
All stereotaxic
coordinates were determined using Paxinos and Watson Atlas
(Paxinos and Watson, 2005).


[CHUNK 7780]
Induction of Striatal Cerebral Ischemia
The rat model of ischemia (group 1; ET1) receiving 60 pmol/3 µL
injection of endothelin-1 (ET1; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON,
Canada) into the right striatum (anterior/posterior +0.5 mm,
medial/lateral −3.0 mm relative to bregma, and dorsoventral
−5.0 mm below dura) has been described in detail elsewhere
(Amtul et al., 2014, 2018a,b,c).


[CHUNK 7781]
Induction of β-Amyloid Toxicity
The rat model of β-amyloid toxicity (group 2; Aβ) receiving
bilateral ICV injections of oligomeric 50 nM Aβ25–35/10 µL was
modeled (anterior/posterior: −0.8 mm, mediolateral: ± 1.4 mm
relative to bregma, and dorsoventral: −4.0 mm below dura) as
described in detail elsewhere (Amtul et al., 2014, 2018a,b,c).


[CHUNK 7782]
Induction of Comorbidity and Control
Procedure
Third group of rats received both bilateral ICV Aβ25–35 and
unilateral striatal ET1 injections (group 3; Aβ+ET1) as described
(Amtul et al., 2014, 2018a,b,c). 

[CHUNK 7783]
The control rats (group 4; Control)
received saline injections in identical locations.


[CHUNK 7784]
Post-surgery Treatment
After stitching the skin incisions, all rats were administered a
subcutaneous injection of 0.03 mg/kg buprenorphine (Temgesic,
RB Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Berkshire, United Kingdom) and an
intramuscular injection of 1 mg/20 µl enroﬂoxacin antibiotic
(Baytril, Bayer Inc., Canada). 

[CHUNK 7785]
Twenty four hours (d1), 7 days
(d7), and 28 days (d28) following surgery, corresponding rats
were euthanized by an intraperitoneal pentobarbital overdose

containing phosphate buﬀered saline (PBS) and thereafter by 4%
paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4).


[CHUNK 7788]
Tissue Preparation
The brains were harvested, postﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
and cryopreserved in 30% cold (4◦C) sucrose solution for 36 h.
Next, the entire rat brains were serially sliced into 35 µm thick
coronal cryosections.


[CHUNK 7789]
Immunohistochemistry
Immunoperoxidase
protocol
of
avidin-biotin-peroxidase
complex (ABC) was carried out as described (Hsu et al.,
1981) to stain the free-ﬂoating cryosections with the following
antibodies:
Matrix
metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9;
1:1000,
Millipore, AB19016), β-dystroglycan (βDG; 1:200, Leica B-DG-
CE-S); βDG is an extracellular matrix adhesion protein abundant
in astrocytic endfeet, co-localized with AQP4 and laminin and
is needed for precise astrocytic anchoring around the cerebral
vasculature (Zaccaria et al., 2001; Milner et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 7790]
SMI71
(Covance, 1:2000), an explicit endothelial barrier antigen (EBA)
restricted to the luminal surfaces of all mature endothelium of
the vasculature with intact BBB. 

[CHUNK 7791]
BM-Laminin (1:1000, Sigma,
L 9393) staining was used as an indicator of the BM rupturing,
while neurons also contain laminin like molecules. 

[CHUNK 7792]
For astrocytic
antigen, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000, Sigma,
G3893) and binary water-channel protein, aquaporin4 (AQP4,
1:1000, Chemicon, AB2218) were employed. 

[CHUNK 7793]
Fluorophore-
conjugated donkey anti-rabbit FITC ( Sc-2090, 1:500) and
donkey anti-mouse TR, (Sc-2785, 1:500) were prepared in 0.3%
Triton X-100 containing 0.1 M PBS were used for ﬂuorescence
staining. 

[CHUNK 7794]
Serums, biotinylated antibodies, and ABC reagent
were purchased from the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, United States).


[CHUNK 7795]
Analyses
Histological sections of brain were analyzed under light and
ﬂuorescence microscope. 

[CHUNK 7796]
Leica Digital Camera DC 300 (Leica
Microsystems Ltd., Heerbrugg, Switzerland) connected to a Leitz
Diaplan microscope was used to take the photomicrographs.


[CHUNK 7797]
Cells and blood vessels were identiﬁed and counted, blindly, on
the basis of positive labeling in the region of interest (ROI) on
six non-neighboring slices with 210 µm distance between the
sections using systematic random sampling method.


[CHUNK 7798]
The Region of Interest Determination
The region of positive laminin staining on consecutive slices in
the right hemisphere (ipsilateral to the striatal ischemia) was
noted as the location of the signal. 

[CHUNK 7799]
This signal was limited to the
striatal region between 1.6 to −0.92 mm anterior to posterior,
relative to bregma. 

[CHUNK 7800]
All histological analyses were performed
in this region of the sections. 

[CHUNK 7801]
The center of the ROI with
dense laminin staining may alternatively be termed as lesion
epicenter or lesion core, while the ROI surrounding the epicenter
is termed as penumbra throughout the study. 

[CHUNK 7802]
Six microscopic
ﬁelds-of-view (each covering an area of about 0.50 mm2) in the
ROI at 10× to 40× magniﬁcation with 0.25 to 0.65 numerical
aperture were analyzed.


[CHUNK 7803]
Lumen Diameter Measurement
The diameters of lumen were determined using the ImageJ’s
(National Institute of Health, version 1.48, United States)
diameterJ plug-in analysis tool. 

[CHUNK 7804]
Pixels in images with known
scale bars were converted into micrometer in Image J. Next,
a line selection was drawn across the structure of interest to
measure the diameters.


[CHUNK 7805]
Vessel/Cell Density Measurement
For vascular/cellular density both manual as well as cell counter
plugin was used to count the number of stained cells, vessels,
layered vessels, split vessels, vessels with ﬁbrosis and vessels with
greater sizes. 

[CHUNK 7806]
The results were presented as the number of vessels
or cells per millimeter square of the ROI. 

[CHUNK 7807]
Eﬀect of MMP-9 on
vascular ﬁbrosis was quantiﬁed by calculating the ratio of the
MMP-9 expression relative to the number of vessels displaying
the ﬁbrosis and expressed as negative log of n.
AQP4 Polarization Measurement
AQP4 polarization is characterized as its dense, concentrated and
localized expression within the astrocytic endfeet, ensheathing
the BBB interface of cerebral microvessels, related to the
astrocytic soma. 

[CHUNK 7808]
Likewise, the loss of localized expression of
AQP4 from perivascular endfeet processes and shifting toward
astrocytic soma and coarse processes is referred to as its
depolarization. 

[CHUNK 7809]
AQP4 polarization was measured by counting
the number of vessels expressing the AQP4 at their perivascular
astrocytic BBB interface within each ﬁeld of view. 

[CHUNK 7810]
The relative
values for AQP4 polarization on d7 and d28 were expressed as
a percentage of the AQP4 polarization on d1 by normalizing
it to 100 percent.


[CHUNK 7811]
Fluid-Filled Spaces Measurement
Fluid-ﬁlled spaces in the ROI were determined by drawing them
on the computer screen with the help of image J quantiﬁcation
plugin analysis tools. 

[CHUNK 7812]
The ﬂuid-ﬁlled space on each section was
normalized to the corresponding striatal volume, and thereafter
to hemispheric swelling by dividing the contralateral hemisphere
volume to the ipsilateral hemispheric volumes, multiplying by
ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces. 

[CHUNK 7813]
The relative area of ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces on d7
and d28 was calculated as the percentage volume of the ﬂuid-ﬁlled
spaces on d1 by normalizing it to 100 on d1.


[CHUNK 7814]
Statistical Analyses
All values were displayed as a mean ± standard error of the
mean (S.E.M.). 

[CHUNK 7815]
All measurements were analyzed by using one-
way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett’s tests. 

[CHUNK 7816]
Except for
inter-group comparisons at diﬀerent time points, a t-test was
used, and log values, two-way ANOVA was used. 

[CHUNK 7817]
The signiﬁcance
level was p ≤0.05.

Cerebral Injury and Vascular Defects
RESULTS
This
is
the
ﬁrst
comprehensive
histopathologic
study
of
blood
vessels
pathology
after
the
comorbid
cerebral
injury.


[CHUNK 7821]
These
data
suggest
that
the
development
of
vascular
pathology
is
a
global
phenomenon
that
aﬀects
the
vascular
dilation,
lumen
diameter,
basement
membrane
integrity
as
well
as
the
ﬂuid
homeostasis
across
the
injured
region
after
comorbid
ischemia
and
amyloid toxicity.


[CHUNK 7822]
Dilated Blood Vessels and Lumen
Diameter
In control rats, laminin antibody only detected neurons, and
in Aβ rats a few faint, isolated microvessels at each time
point (Figure 1A). 

[CHUNK 7823]
This is consistent with the literature that
shows that in PFA-perfused tissues the laminin antibody
does not stain BM-laminin but only neurons (Hagg et al.,
1989). 

[CHUNK 7824]
Conversely, a signiﬁcantly robust network of capillaries
containing BM-laminin is usually promptly evident after
Aβ+ET1 or ET1 injections in the lesion epicenter due
to the damage to BM and enhanced antibody penetration
resulting in the robust staining of laminin protein. 

[CHUNK 7825]
Alongside
an intermittent yet widespread increase in the diameter
of microvessels (square boxes) within the lesion core of
Aβ+ET1 than ET1 rats (p = 0.054) was readily detected
immediately
after
the
injury
compared
to
the
control
(p = 0.0005) and Aβ (p = 0.0006) rats (Figures 1B,D).


[CHUNK 7826]
Numerous thinning out laminin-positive pyknotic neurons
were also obvious in the lesion core of ET1 and Aβ+ET1
rats on d1 (Figure 1B). 

[CHUNK 7827]
Dilated microvessels in ET1 and
Aβ+ET1 rats with larger lumen diameter (Figures 1C,E) also
demonstrate punctate SMI71 staining of the luminal surface
of the endothelial cells indicating BBB break down in those
microvessels (Figure 1C).

Cerebral Injury and Vascular Defects
Basement Membrane Proﬁle and
Disruption
Basement membrane pathology including splitting, dissolution
and rupturing was more prominent in ET1 rats compared to
layering out tunica intima in Aβ+ET1 rats, that represents an
earlier step to splitting (Figures 2A,B,D,E). 

[CHUNK 7846]
On d28, laminin
meshwork with degraded BM can be seen throughout the
lesion core with more pronounced splitting around digested
microvessels in ET1 rats and distinct layering in Aβ+ET1
rats (Figures 2C–E). 

[CHUNK 7847]
Additionally, ET1 rats on d7 showed
the splitting of BM-laminin with irregular SMI expression. 

[CHUNK 7848]
In
contrast, Aβ+ET1 rats showed layering of BM with relatively
regular BBB (Figure 2B). 

[CHUNK 7849]
Images on both ﬂuorescent and
0.05% DAB staining were included to provide readers better
clarity and resolution that might have been missed by the one
procedure or another.

MMP-9 Expression and Microvascular
Fibrosis
In control and Aβ rats, MMP-9 appeared to stain a large
number of neuronal cells, as obvious from their structure and
distribution pattern (Figure 3A). 

[CHUNK 7851]
While in ET1 and Aβ+ET1
rats on d1, MMP-9 stained striatal cells that appeared to be
the reminiscent of microvascular endothelium, representing the
disturbed vascular-matrix connection, with more in ET1 and
less in Aβ+ET1 rats (Figure 3B). 

[CHUNK 7852]
On d7, in the penumbra-core
interface MMP-9 started appearing as astrocytes (Figure 3C).


[CHUNK 7853]
On d28 MMP-9 staining showed complete loss of endothelial
proﬁle observed on d1, and strongly indicated an expression
of astrocytes in the lesion core with signiﬁcantly more in ET1
brains than Aβ+ET1 (p < 0.05) rats (Figure 3D). 

[CHUNK 7854]
Besides, the
capillary structure in the lesion core started getting severely
compromised (Figure 3E). 

[CHUNK 7855]
The percent ﬁbrosis of vessels in
Aβ+ET1 rats was strongly correlated with an MMP-9 increase
(p = 0.033) in the lesion core, suggesting that ﬁbrosis was
a critical process in the penumbra of Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7856]
The
images themselves contain suﬃcient detail to clearly display
capillary structures, allowing the visualization of principal
BM layer and the vasculature. 

[CHUNK 7857]
More detailed visualization of
capillary atrophy intercalated by a dense BM network included
string, fragmented and tortuous structures (circle). 

[CHUNK 7858]
An uneven
thickening on the abluminal surface of capillaries, duplication,
branching (three arrows), and microvascular ﬁbrosis of BM
(dotted line), was common in the lesion core of treated
rats, in general.

On d7, the BM starts splitting out in ET1 rats and layering out in Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7861]
A punctate
and faint SMI71 staining indicative of disrupted BBB is also observed in microvessels with greater BM-laminin leakage, dissolution, and destabilization (B).

Cerebral Injury and Vascular Defects
AQP4 Polarization vs. 

[CHUNK 7904]
Fluid Homeostasis
Within 24 h, AQP4 staining was highly polarized around
endothelial cells of microvessels in control (p = 0.002) and Aβ
(p = 0.001) brains compared to the ET1 and Aβ+ET1 brains. 

[CHUNK 7905]
On
the contrary, AQP4 staining appeared punctate in the lesion core
of ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7906]
While the neuropil space in between the
AQP4 stained vessels was missing any AQP4 staining in Aβ+ET1
rats, in ET1 rats it exhibited haziness indicative of relocation
of AQP4 protein (Figure 4A). 

[CHUNK 7907]
On d7, the depolarization of
AQP4 became more distinct in ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats and
a hazy ﬂuorescence appeared to extend into the neighboring
neuropil compared to control and Aβ rats (Figure 4B). 

[CHUNK 7908]
On d28,
an increased AQP4 immunoreactivity was accompanied by the
re-distribution of polarized AQP4 expression from astrocytic
endfeet to the soma with more in ET1 rats than Aβ+ET1
rats (Figure 4C). 

[CHUNK 7909]
A subset of microvessels in Aβ rats showed
AQP4 haziness and depolarization on d28; however, it did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Figure 4C). 

[CHUNK 7910]
Low-resolution
images indicated the topographical immunostaining of GFAP
(Figure 4D), and βDG positive (Figure 4E) astrocytes in the
ipsilateral striatum of Aβ+ET1 rat brain on d28. 

[CHUNK 7911]
On d1, both
ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats had approximately a100% increase in
ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces in the ROI compared to control and Aβ rats,
consistent with the vasogenic edema formation (Figures 4D,G).


[CHUNK 7912]
While, on d28 with the increase in AQP4 depolarization, the
size of these ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces got shrunk to one-third of their
original size from d1 (R = 0.96, p = 0.0001) (Figure 4E). 

[CHUNK 7913]
The
dark line showed the division between core and penumbra,
where a palisade layer is formed by GFAP positive astrocytes.


[CHUNK 7914]
While βDG expression on astrocytic end feet demonstrates an
attempt by the astrocytes to restore vascular-matrix connections
(Figures 4D,E). 

[CHUNK 7915]
The high-resolution image showed co-labeling of
AQP4 and GFAP staining to demonstrate AQP4 depolarization
from astrocytic foot processes to soma in the ﬂuid-ﬁlled space
in an Aβ+ET1 rat on d28, in an attempt to increase the
inter-compartmental water exchange from ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces to
the bloodstreams (Figure 4F). 

[CHUNK 7916]
Co-expressed GFAP and AQP4
staining were not used for any quantitative analyses.


[CHUNK 7917]
DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate that the comorbid occurrence
of ischemia and Aβ toxicity provoked substantial dynamic,
rapid and highly coordinated changes in the vascular anatomy
and physiology in the striatal lesion core and penumbra of
Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7918]
The present study also showed a correlation
between vascular structure deterioration and the deﬁcits in
microvascular responses, such as inter-compartmental water
exchange and vessel-matrix-connections of cerebral capillaries
after comorbid injury.


[CHUNK 7919]
Immediately after ET1 and/or Aβ+ET1 injections, the
compression of small capillaries (not arterioles and venules) and
a drop in cerebral perfusion, due to the potent vasoconstrictive
eﬀects of ET1, led to the dilation of precapillary resistance vessels
in order to maintain cerebral perfusion. 

[CHUNK 7920]
This was observed by
the homogenous distribution of certain vessels with increased
diameter throughout the penumbra in Aβ+ET1 rats compared to
ET1 rats on d1. 

[CHUNK 7921]
This shifted the calculated average size of vessels
to the considerably larger values in Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7922]
Whereas the
changes in the microvessels structure in ET1 rats accompanied
by a decrease in the outer diameters of the vessel lumen. 

[CHUNK 7923]
These
alterations perhaps referring to some hyperplasia or hypertrophy
of the vessel wall in these rats, signiﬁcantly impacted vascular
function (Baumbach and Heistad, 1989). 

[CHUNK 7924]
This also referred to a
diﬀerent pattern of remodeling in Aβ+ET1 rats compared to ET1
rats alone (Figure 1).


[CHUNK 7925]
Following ﬂow restoration in the constricted vessels, the
downstream capillary network endured the impact (del Zoppo
et al., 2000). 

[CHUNK 7926]
For instance, in injured rats once maximum
vasodilation was reached, autoregulation failed and progressive
continued compression of small capillaries (Liebeskind, 2003)
ﬁnally resulted in the opening of tight junction proteins of
endothelial cells and breakdown of BBB permeability, as observed
by a punctate EBA or SMI71 staining in ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats on
d7 (Figure 2B).


[CHUNK 7927]
A breakdown of BBB or permeability barrier was accompanied
by signiﬁcant alterations in microvessel structure in these rats.


[CHUNK 7928]
As, spatially endothelial cells are in a perfect position to sense
minor changes in cerebral perfusion, thus shear stress. 

[CHUNK 7929]
These
pathologic changes seemed to ﬁrst aﬀect the intima, media,
and adventitia layers of microvessels. 

[CHUNK 7930]
Immediately after injury,
these layers started separating from the vessels, however, more
robustly in ET1 rats compared to the Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7931]
As, ET1 rats
demonstrated splitting, which is usually followed by a vascular
layering of tunica intima; that comprised of endothelial cells
and the contiguous BM (Stratman et al., 2009), starting from
d7 (Figure 2B). 

[CHUNK 7932]
Possibly, our endpoint timing of euthanization
couldn’t catch the window of vascular layering in ET1 rats.


[CHUNK 7933]
Splitting, in turn, led to multiple tears within the microvascular
layers and BM-endothelium of ET1 rats by d28 (Figure 2C).


[CHUNK 7934]
This study also highlights vascular ﬁbrosis or vascular BM
thickening as a pathologic phenomenon associated with ischemia
and comorbid injury. 

[CHUNK 7935]
In Aβ+ET1 brains, BM suﬀerd the most
dramatic and pronounced damage and emerged as a central
target of vascular pathological changes (Hawkes et al., 2011;
Figure 3). 

[CHUNK 7936]
Vascular ﬁbrosis; linked with many pathological
processes and clinical conditions (Harvey et al., 2016) is
characterized by reduced compliance, such as lumen diameter,
increased vascular collagen, reduced elasticity (Selvin et al., 2010),
and associated excessive deposition/remodeling of extracellular
matrix (ECM) (Iwazu et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 7937]
Increased expression and
activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is characterized
as one of the molecular mechanisms underlying ECM remodeling
and vascular ﬁbrosis (Epstein et al., 1994). 

[CHUNK 7938]
Accordingly, many
of the partially digested microvessels that still remained in
the striatal lesion core were associated with MMP-9 positive
staining in ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats on d1 (Figure 3B) indicating
the diminishing or residual vessel-matrix-connections. 

[CHUNK 7939]
By d28
complex interplay between ischemia, Aβ toxicity and astrocytic
expression of MMP-9 (Zhao et al., 2006; Wang and Hatton,
2009; Figure 3D), resulted in accelerated vascular remodeling
(as observed by elevated astrocytic expression) in ET1 rats and
ﬁbrosis (as accompanied by lowered astrocytic expression) in

Cerebral Injury and Vascular Defects
Aβ+ET1 rats. 

[CHUNK 7942]
This again conﬁrms a diﬀerent pattern of
remodeling in ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats, as mentioned above.


[CHUNK 7943]
In addition, the presence of cerebral microvessels with string,
tortuous structures (Figure 3E) and reduced capillary density in
Aβ+ET1 rats may be responsible for the increased resistance of
microvessels and resulting moderate hemodynamic obstruction
in these rats by d28, reported earlier (Yang et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 7944]
The very peculiar set of idiosyncratic variations was noticed
in the polarized expression of end feet pool of AQP4 from
d1 to d28 (Figure 4). 

[CHUNK 7945]
Within 24 h, punctate, granulated,
polarized expression of AQP4 channel protein, enclosing the
cerebral endothelial layers in the lesion core demonstrated re-
localization or redistribution from the end feet membranes
to the parenchymal soma membranes of the astrocyte body
starting from d7 (Wolburg-Buchholz et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 7946]
Perhaps this
is to aid in astroglial migration toward ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces in
forming glial scar in the lesion core, necessary for ﬁlopodia
formation (Saadoun, 2005; Badaut et al., 2007), as well as to
help in intra-astroglial water accumulation or cytotoxic edema
in an eﬀort to clear up ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces formed in the lesion
core of ET1 and Aβ+ET1 rats on d1 (Figures 4D,E). 

[CHUNK 7947]
On d28,
the reduction in ﬂuid-ﬁlled spaces in injured rats when AQP4
depolarization was at its peak, conﬁrmed its role as the principle
bidirectional water transporting channel of astrocytes (Nagelhus
et al., 2004) and thus in ﬂuid clearance from the brain into
the bloodstream.


[CHUNK 7948]
Currently, it is uncertain if Aβ rats will express signiﬁcant
degeneration in vascular physiology and markers in a four-
week time frame, as Aβ toxicity alone was not detrimental
enough. 

[CHUNK 7949]
Low numbers of animals per group (n = 4) might
be a contributing limiting factor. 

[CHUNK 7950]
However, in the given time,
striatal microvessels in the Aβ rats showed vascular degeneration
and BBB disruption compared with controls, although non-
signiﬁcantly. 

[CHUNK 7951]
Further studies with extended time intervals will
likely provide an enhanced appreciation of the structural links of
vascular injury with vascular responses in these rats.


[CHUNK 7952]
In summary, we propose that the anatomical or morphological
alterations in the cerebral network of microvessels after injury
could be used eﬀectively to describe the neuropathology of the
injured brain. 

[CHUNK 7953]
For example, the impaired BBB restoration after
Aβ+ET1 toxicity reported earlier (Amtul et al., 2018d) might be
the direct cause of the altered anatomy of the cerebral vasculature
in these rats. 

[CHUNK 7954]
Lastly, longitudinal magnetic resonance evaluations
can aid to correlate imaging of vessel size and microvascular
morphology to the fate of neural tissue to further improve the
tailoring of the treatments. 

[CHUNK 7955]
Such an investigation could lead
to a new rationale to induce vascular remodeling by designing
therapeutics for demented patients.

Background: The relationship between cognitive impairment and abdominal visceral
is controversial. 

[CHUNK 8193]
Moreover, all studies so far used imaging studies to evaluate visceral
fat and this association has not been described yet using autopsy material, which
allows the direct quantiﬁcation of abdominal fat. 

[CHUNK 8194]
We aimed to investigate the association
between direct measurements of abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment in an
autopsy study.


[CHUNK 8195]
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected information on sociodemographics,
cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive status from subjects aged 50 or older at time of
death in a general autopsy service in Brazil. 

[CHUNK 8196]
Abdominal visceral fat was obtained in natura
by the dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat. 

[CHUNK 8197]
The associations
of total abdominal visceral fat with cognitive impairment [clinical dementia rating (CDR)
score ≥0.5] and CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were evaluated using logistic regression
and negative binomial regression models, respectively. 

[CHUNK 8198]
All analyses were adjusted for
height, age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol
use, and physical inactivity. 

[CHUNK 8199]
In addition, we compared the discrimination of visceral
fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) measurements in predicting
cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 8200]
Results: We evaluated 234 participants (mean age = 71.2 ± 12.9 years old, 59% male).


[CHUNK 8201]
Abdominal visceral fat was inversely associated with cognitive impairment (OR = 0.46,
CI = 0.30; 0.70, p < 0.0001) and with CDR-SB scores (β = −0.85, 95% CI = −1.28;
−0.43, p < 0.0001). 

[CHUNK 8202]
When we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC),

Visceral Fat and Dementia
visceral fat (AUC = 0.754), BMI (AUC = 0.729), and WC (AUC = 0.720) showed similar
discrimination in predicting cognitive impairment (p = 0.38).


[CHUNK 8205]
Conclusion: In an autopsy study, larger amount of directly measured abdominal visceral
fat was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older adults.

INTRODUCTION
Dementia is a common disease among the older population,
affecting around 50 million people worldwide with projections
indicating that dementia will affect 152 million by 2050
(Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2010; WHO, 2017). 

[CHUNK 8207]
It is
also a main cause of disability and dependency among older
people (Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2010; WHO, 2017).


[CHUNK 8208]
Similarly, obesity prevalence had almost tripled in the last
40 years, leading to an increased risk for cardiovascular
diseases (Bastien et al., 2014; Ebbert et al., 2014; Mandviwala
et al., 2016; WHO, 2018). 

[CHUNK 8209]
Results on the relationship between
obesity and dementia are conflicting. 

[CHUNK 8210]
Being overweight or
obese in midlife was associated with higher risk of dementia
in later life (Whitmer et al., 2005; Hassing et al., 2009;
Pedditizi et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 8211]
However, the association of late-life
obesity and dementia in unclear with studies showing a
reverse (Buchman et al., 2005; Dahl et al., 2008; West and
Haan, 2009; Cronk et al., 2010; Power et al., 2011; Pedditizi
et al., 2016), a positive (Gustafson et al., 2003), and also
no association (Luchsinger et al., 2007) between obesity and
dementia in late-life.


[CHUNK 8212]
Although most of the previous studies have evaluated
adiposity using body mass index (BMI) as an assessment of
obesity, this anthropometric measurement may not the best
marker of adiposity because it cannot distinguish between
fat and lean mass, nor between visceral abdominal fat and
subcutaneous abdominal fat (Cereda et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 8213]
The validity
of BMI as a measure of adiposity is especially problematic
in older adults, who experience changes in body composition,
such as decrease in muscle mass and bone mineralization,
and increase in body fat (Zamboni et al., 1997; Noel and
Reddy, 2005). 

[CHUNK 8214]
Other measurements of adiposity, such as waist
circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and abdominal
visceral fat may be more appropriate in this age group (Hassing
et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 8215]
In mid-life, some anthropometric measurements
such as skinfold thickness (Whitmer et al., 2005) and sagittal
abdominal diameter (Whitmer et al., 2008) were associated
with higher risk of dementia in late life. 

[CHUNK 8216]
On the other
hand, prior studies have shown a positive (West and Haan,
2009) or no association of WC and cognitive impairment
with dementia in late-life (Luchsinger et al., 2007; Yoon
et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 8217]
Inverse associations of WHR with dementia and
hippocampal volume were reported (Power et al., 2011), as
well as a positive association with white matter hyperintensities
(Jagust et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 8218]
Few studies investigated the association between abdominal
visceral fat and cognitive impairment. 

[CHUNK 8219]
These studies used
imaging methods to evaluate the amount of visceral adipose
tissue (Kamogawa et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2012; Spauwen
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8220]
Prior studies showed no association between
abdominal visceral fat area (Kamogawa et al., 2010; Spauwen
et al., 2017) with cognitive impairment, while another found
a positive association between visceral adipose tissue and poor
cognitive performance, but only in participants younger than
70 years (Yoon et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 8221]
Autopsy studies can generate more
reliable data due to the possibility of direct measurements of
visceral fat surrounding different abdominal organs, as well
as the total amount of visceral adiposity (van der Kooy and
Seidell, 1993). 

[CHUNK 8222]
However, to our knowledge, the association
between cognitive impairment and abdominal visceral fat has
not been investigated using autopsy material. 

[CHUNK 8223]
Therefore, we
aimed to evaluate this association in a large population-based
autopsy study.


[CHUNK 8224]
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
This cross-sectional study was conducted at the São Paulo
Autopsy
Service
(SPAS)
from
University
of
São
Paulo.


[CHUNK 8225]
Data were collected from October 2011 to April 2014.


[CHUNK 8226]
The SPAS performs autopsy in individuals who died from
non-traumatic causes of death with unclear diagnosis during
life in São Paulo, Brazil (Grinberg et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 8227]
This study
was approved by the institutional review board, and the
informant who agreed to participate in the study signed a written
informed consent.


[CHUNK 8228]
We included individuals aged 50 years or older at time of
death, who had an informant with at least weekly contact with
the deceased in the last 6 months prior to death. 

[CHUNK 8229]
Exclusion
criteria were inability to obtain reliable data from the informant,
post-mortem interval >24 h, weight loss of 10% or more in
the last 6 months prior to death, signs of autolysis according
to Crossley criteria (Crossley, 1974), and retained material by
the pathologist.


[CHUNK 8230]
Sociodemographic and Clinical Data
Information about sociodemographic data (age, sex, race, marital
status, and education), frequency of contact of the informant
with the deceased, and cardiovascular risk factors (current
smoking and alcohol use, physical inactivity, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, and stroke) were obtained with the informant
using a semi-structured interview. 

[CHUNK 8231]
The cause of death and the
post-mortem interval were collected from the autopsy report.


[CHUNK 8232]
Weight and height were measured with the deceased without
clothes in the supine position. 

[CHUNK 8233]
BMI was calculated by dividing

the weight in kilogram by the squared height in meters. 

[CHUNK 8236]
WC was
measured with an inelastic tape in the region of the umbilicus
(Nishizawa et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 8237]
Cognitive Assessment
We evaluated the cognitive impairment using the Clinical
Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (Hughes et al., 1982; Morris et al.,
1997), which contains questions regarding six areas involved in
cognition (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving,
community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care).


[CHUNK 8238]
We used only the informant part of the CDR scale due to
study design. 

[CHUNK 8239]
Individuals were classified into five groups: no
impairment (CDR = 0); questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5); mild
dementia (CDR = 1); moderate dementia (CDR = 2); and severe
dementia (CDR = 3). 

[CHUNK 8240]
Individuals with CDR = 0 were considered
with normal cognition, and those with CDR ≥0.5 were
considered with cognitive impairment (Suemoto et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8241]
We
also used the sum of the boxes for each domain for the CDR sum
of boxes (CDR-SB) score, which ranged from 0 to 18 (O’Bryant
et al., 2008).


[CHUNK 8242]
Evaluation of Abdominal Visceral Fat
The abdominal visceral fat was obtained by the in natura
dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat,
and weighed using a calibrated electronic scale (Toledo Brazil®
model 3,400/05). 

[CHUNK 8243]
The weight values were expressed in grams (g).


[CHUNK 8244]
To avoid measurement error, we were careful to calibrate the
scale before each use. 

[CHUNK 8245]
Subsequently, the values of all fat deposits
were summed to obtain a measure of the total abdominal visceral
fat and expressed in kilograms (kg; Nishizawa et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 8246]
Assessment of Other Adiposity
Measurements
We measured the deceased’s weight in kg using a calibrated
electronic scale, and the height in centimeters (cm) using
a stadiometer. 

[CHUNK 8247]
Both measurements were performed with the
individual in supine position and without any clothes. 

[CHUNK 8248]
Then,
we calculated the BMI in kg/m2. 

[CHUNK 8249]
We measured the WC in the
umbilicus region. 

[CHUNK 8250]
The abdominal subcutaneous tissue thickness
(ASTT) was measured at the abdominal midline, 4 cm above the
umbilicus. 

[CHUNK 8251]
WC and ASTT were in cm, using an inelastic tape
(Nishizawa et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 8252]
Statistical Analysis
A sample size of 200 participants was estimated using a power
of 80%, an alpha level of 5%, and a medium effect size of
0.3 for the correlation between abdominal visceral fat and
cognitive impairment in two-tailed tests (Cohen, 1992). 

[CHUNK 8253]
We used
mean and standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables,
or absolute and relative frequency for categorical variables
to
describe
the
sample
characteristics.


[CHUNK 8254]
Sociodemographic
and
cardiovascular
risk
factors
were
compared
among
individuals with and without cognitive impairment, using
unpaired t-test for continuous variables, and chi-square test for
categorical ones.


[CHUNK 8255]
The dependent variables were cognitive impairment evaluated
by a binary variable (CDR categorized into 0 and ≥0.5) and by
a continuous variable (CDR-SB); and the independent variable
was the amount of abdominal visceral fat (continuous variable).


[CHUNK 8256]
As a sensitivity analysis, we also investigated the association
between visceral fat and dementia (CDR ≥1), excluding those
with CDR = 0.5. 

[CHUNK 8257]
To evaluate the association between abdominal
visceral fat and cognitive impairment, we used logistic regression.


[CHUNK 8258]
The association between abdominal visceral fat and CDR-SB
was evaluated using negative binomial regression. 

[CHUNK 8259]
Both analyses
were adjusted for height, age, sex, education, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, and physical
inactivity. 

[CHUNK 8260]
Based on the fact that the association between
obesity and CDR-SB could be different according to age groups
(Yoon et al., 2012), we also included an interaction term
between age and visceral fat. 

[CHUNK 8261]
Finally, we calculated measures of
abdominal visceral fat accuracy and compared the discrimination
of visceral fat, BMI, WC, and ASST measurements in predicting
cognitive impairment using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curves (AUC). 

[CHUNK 8262]
We then compared the AUC using
the nonparametric methods described by DeLong et al. 

[CHUNK 8263]
(1988).


[CHUNK 8264]
The alpha level was set at 0.05 in two-tailed tests. 

[CHUNK 8265]
We used
Stata 12 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA) to perform the
statistical analyses.


[CHUNK 8266]
RESULTS
During the study period, 1,647 subjects were eligible to
participate in this study. 

[CHUNK 8267]
Two-hundred and thirty-four subjects
met the eligibility criteria for this study (Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 8268]
Included
and excluded subjects had similar age (Included: 71.16 ± 12.98;
excluded: 70.02 ± 12.20; p = 0.19), and sex distribution (Included:
58.5% men; excluded: 58.2% men; p = 0.93). 

[CHUNK 8269]
Thus, the study
sample had similar demographic characteristics to the source
population. 

[CHUNK 8270]
Compared to participants with normal cognition,
the 59 participants (25%) with cognitive impairment were older
and mostly female. 

[CHUNK 8271]
In addition, participants with cognitive
impairment had more stroke, were more physically inactive, had
lower values of BMI, and lower amount of abdominal visceral
fat (Table 1).


[CHUNK 8272]
We observed that an increase in abdominal visceral fat was
associated with lower scores in the CDR-SB after adjustment for

[CHUNK 8283]
Similarly, we also found that the increase
in abdominal visceral fat was associated with 54% fewer odds of
cognitive impairment (OR = 0.46, CI = 0.30; 0.71, p < 0.0001).


[CHUNK 8284]
Sensitivity analysis confirmed that a larger amount of visceral fat
was associated with lower odds of dementia (Table 3).

Additionally, we observed an interaction between abdominal
visceral fat and age on the association between CDR-SB and
visceral fat (β = 0.018, 95% CI = 0.004; 0.031, p = 0.01;

[CHUNK 8314]
Moreover,
we also found an interaction between age and visceral fat
on the association between visceral fat and CDR-SB scores
that suggests that this inverse association was more severe in
older participants. 

[CHUNK 8315]
Anthropometric measurements, ASTT and
autopsy-measured visceral fat showed similar discriminations for
cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 8316]
Several studies have demonstrated that overweight or obese
individuals in midlife were at a higher risk of cognitive
impairment in late life (Whitmer et al., 2005; Hassing et al.,
2009; Pedditizi et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 8317]
On the other hand, if adiposity
and dementia were analyzed in late-life, the results are
conflicting. 

[CHUNK 8318]
Our results with direct measurements of abdominal
visceral fat are in line with some prior studies that generally
support an inverse association between obesity and cognitive
impairment (Nourhashémi et al., 2003; Buchman et al., 2005;
Dahl et al., 2008; West and Haan, 2009; Cronk et al., 2010;
Power et al., 2011; Pedditizi et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 8319]
For example, a
significant decrease in BMI (>10%) in late-life was related to
a 118% greater risk of developing dementia in the following
3 years (Atti et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 8320]
Another study did not find an
association between BMI and late-life dementia (Luchsinger
et al., 2007), while higher BMI was related to a higher risk of
cognitive impairment, especially in certain groups, as women
(Gustafson et al., 2003) and those younger than 70 years
(Yoon et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 8321]
While
we
observed
an
inverse
association
between
abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment using autopsy
material,
previous
imaging
studies
found
no
association
between abdominal visceral fat area and cognitive impairment
(Kamogawa et al., 2010; Spauwen et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8322]
On the other
hand, a positive association between visceral adipose tissue
and poor cognitive performance, but only in participants
younger than 70 years (Yoon et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 8323]
Another study among
184 older adults without cognitive impairment evaluated the
visceral fat and the brain structure using magnetic resonance
imaging (Isaac et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 8324]
Visceral fat accumulation was
associated with worse performance on memory and attention
tests, and lower hippocampal volume (Isaac et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 8325]
In 1,570 older adults, visceral fat and peripheral fat mass
measured by the bioelectrical impedance were related to a
higher risk of severe cognitive impairment (Papachristou
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 8326]
Finally, total fat mass was evaluated using
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and visceral fat by computed
tomography in 3,054 elderly individuals. 

[CHUNK 8327]
Higher levels of
adiposity were associated with worsening cognition only in men
(Kanaya et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 8328]
Although imaging studies are the most similar to ours since
they measured the visceral fat, the quantification of abdominal
visceral fat by autopsy is the ‘‘gold standard’’ because it allows
the direct measurement of the visceral fat surrounding different
abdominal organs (van der Kooy and Seidell, 1993). 

[CHUNK 8329]
Indeed,
the different findings in imaging studies could be related to the
indirect measurement of visceral fat. 

[CHUNK 8330]
In addition, some important
differences in the sample composition need to be noted. 

[CHUNK 8331]
Previous
studies were performed in high-income countries (Kanaya et al.,
2009; Kamogawa et al., 2010; Isaac et al., 2011; Yoon et al.,
2012; Spauwen et al., 2017), while this study was performed in
a low-middle income country from Latin America with great
ethnic diversity and lower levels of education. 

[CHUNK 8332]
Although direct
measurements of visceral fat are the most accurate measurement
of adiposity, we found that visceral fat, BMI, WC, and ASTT had
similar discrimination to predict cognitive impairment in our
sample. 

[CHUNK 8333]
This finding suggests that both BMI and WC, which are
accessible anthropometric measures, could be used to evaluate
adiposity and the risk of cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 8334]
An explanation for our findings is reverse causation. 

[CHUNK 8335]
A prior
study showed that participants with lower BMI at baseline
had lower memory scores after 10 years. 

[CHUNK 8336]
Inversely, participants
with lower memory scores in baseline presented a decline in
BMI in the following decade. 

[CHUNK 8337]
They also demonstrated that
preclinical dementia may influence the body composition by
weight loss even in individuals in their late 50s (Suemoto et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 8338]
Since weight loss may begin upto 20 years prior to the
onset of the dementia (Knopman et al., 2007), maybe these
results may be reflecting the preclinical phase of dementia. 

[CHUNK 8339]
In a
longitudinal study of 8-years of follow-up, lower BMI increased
dementia risk in older people.

[CHUNK 8344]
Nishizawa et al.


[CHUNK 8345]
Visceral Fat and Dementia
cases diagnosed at 1–3 years of follow-up were excluded from
analysis, this relationship was not significant, suggesting that
lower BMI is probably not a risk factor, but an early clinical
sign of the dementia (Nourhashémi et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 8346]
In the same
way, a previous autopsy study showed that the higher levels of
AD neuropathology were associated with lower BMI in both
participants with and without dementia. 

[CHUNK 8347]
It suggests that AD
pathology may contribute to weight loss even in the preclinical
phase of dementia (Buchman et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 8348]
In another study,
individuals with early AD had less lean mass compared with
non-demented individuals (Burns et al., 2010), as well as lower
weight and BMI.


[CHUNK 8349]
Additionally, our findings of lower visceral fat with higher
odds of cognitive impairment was expected since cognition and
abdominal visceral fat were evaluated at the same time, and our
sample was mainly of older adults. 

[CHUNK 8350]
The significant interaction
between age and visceral fat on the association between visceral
fat and CDR-SB scores found in this study also shows that lower
BMI was associated with higher cognitive impairment in older
participants than in younger ones. 

[CHUNK 8351]
In addition, our findings
may be consequent to malnourishment associated with overt
clinical dementia. 

[CHUNK 8352]
Dementia may interfere with the imbalance
between energy intake and energy expenditure through different
mechanisms, such as damage to appetite control, forgetting
to eat, refusal to eat, increased energy expenditure, apraxia,
communication problems in relation to the desire of eating,
impaired decision-making ability, and decreased interest in food
due to apathy (Aziz et al., 2008; Droogsma et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 8353]
Another possible explanation is that obesity is, in fact,
protective against cognitive impairment due to the excess of
leptin, a hormone involved in obesity pathogenesis and also
related to memory and learning (Fewlass et al., 2004; Farr
et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 8354]
A prior study showed that higher leptin levels
were associated with greater BMI and total percent body fat.


[CHUNK 8355]
Individuals with higher levels of leptin had nearly 50% less
cognitive decline compared with those with lower leptin levels
(Holden et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 8356]
Additional longitudinal studies with long
follow-up periods (e.g., 30 years or more) followed by autopsy,
with direct measurements of visceral abdominal fat and leptin
levels are necessary to clarify this association.


[CHUNK 8357]
Based on our findings as well as on results from prior
studies, we need to emphasize two points. 

[CHUNK 8358]
First, we found that
lower amounts of directly measured visceral fat were associated
with higher odds of cognitive impairment in older participants.


[CHUNK 8359]
Therefore, it is important to evaluate carefully the cognitive
function in older adults, who present with weight loss without
apparent cause, because this symptom can be due to preclinical
or mild dementia. 

[CHUNK 8360]
Second, we found that anthropometrics
measurements that are easy to obtain (BMI and WC) had
similar accuracy in predicting cognitive impairment to visceral
fat, which is more costly to measure since it requires an imaging
exam, as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or
bioelectrical impedance. 

[CHUNK 8361]
Thus, in settings of scarce resources as in
lower middle-income countries, anthropometric measurements
could be used to predict cognitive impairment. 

[CHUNK 8362]
Future research
should investigate the predictive value of investigating patients
with weight loss for cognitive impairment early diagnosis.


[CHUNK 8363]
Our study should be considered regarding the study
limitations. 

[CHUNK 8364]
This is a cross-sectional study, which limits our
ability to draw causal inferences of the adiposity effect on
cognitive impairment. 

[CHUNK 8365]
Moreover, we did not have cognitive
evaluation prior to participants’ death. 

[CHUNK 8366]
To overcome this
important limitation, we only included informants, who had
at least weekly contact with the deceased. 

[CHUNK 8367]
In addition,
the evaluation with the informant was validated in clinical
settings showing good accuracy for the diagnosis of cognitive
impairment (Ferretti et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 8368]
In addition, information
on the association between directly measured visceral fat and
neuropathological lesions is not currently available. 

[CHUNK 8369]
Finally, we
did not have information on laboratory exams, medications,
and family history. 

[CHUNK 8370]
Multiple longitudinal cognitive evaluation
and neuropathological information will be important to clarify
the association between visceral fat and cognitive impairment
in future autopsy studies. 

[CHUNK 8371]
On the other hand, we should
also consider the study strengths. 

[CHUNK 8372]
We measured visceral fat
directly in autopsy material, being possible to anatomically
separate all fats and obtain the total amount of visceral fat.


[CHUNK 8373]
Additionally, our sample is from a low-middle income country
with an ethnically diverse background and with low educational
levels. 

[CHUNK 8374]
In addition, all participants had short post-mortem
intervals, which contributed to the quality of the samples. 

[CHUNK 8375]
We
also compared the discrimination for cognitive impairment of
direct measurements of abdominal visceral with anthropometric
measurements (BMI and WC) and with measurements of
subcutaneous tissue obtained during the autopsy. 

[CHUNK 8376]
Finally, we
also excluded participants that had lost weight recently to limit
the role of reverse causation. 

[CHUNK 8377]
In conclusion, larger amounts of
visceral fat directly measured directly in autopsy material was
associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older
adults from a lower middle-income country.

cases, whereas sporadic cases account for 95% (Masters et al., 2015; Baker et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8671]
Among the
diﬀerent risk factors underlying sporadic cases of AD, infection might play a role in late-onset AD.


[CHUNK 8672]
Over the past three decades, infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa have
been reported to trigger the development of AD (Sochocka et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8673]
The infection hypothesis is
not a recent idea; the involvement of microorganisms in AD progression was proposed by Aloysius
Alzheimer (Fulop et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8674]
In the 1990s, three laboratories from diﬀerent countries associated
the infection with the etiology of AD. 

[CHUNK 8675]
Elderly patients infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV)-
1 developed toxic accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and phosphorylated (p)-tau protein in the
brain (Itzhaki et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 8676]
In autopsy cases with histopathologically conﬁrmed AD, spirochetes
were found in blood, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, and brain tissue (Miklossy, 1993). 

[CHUNK 8677]
A third study by
Balin et al. 

[CHUNK 8678]
reports that Chlamydia pneumoniae was present in post-mortem brain samples from
patients with AD (Balin et al., 1998). 

[CHUNK 8679]
In another study, systemic infection by C. pneumoniae, a
Gram-negative bacterium, was associated with a 5-fold increase in AD occurrence, and in many
AD patients, elevated anti-C. 

[CHUNK 8680]
pneumoniae titers in blood have also been reported (Balin et al.,
2008). 

[CHUNK 8681]
The result from an association study of 128 AD patients and 135 healthy controls provides
evidence of infectious burden, comprising viruses, and bacteria, that is associated with AD (odds
ratio ∼4) (Bu et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 8682]
A national representative survey of US residents involving 1,194 patients
with 1,520 hospitalizations for infection with severe sepsis revealed that sepsis survivors were
independently associated with substantial and persistent new cognitive impairment and functional
disability (Iwashyna et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 8683]
All of these studies support the notion that infectious etiology
might be a causative factor for the inﬂammatory pathway associated with AD progression.


[CHUNK 8684]
The accumulation of misfolded Aβ in the brain has been proposed to be the critical triggering
event in a complex pathophysiological cascade that leads to AD pathology. 

[CHUNK 8685]
The additional
physiological role of Aβ as an antimicrobial agent in in vitro and in vivo models has been shown
by Robert Moir and Rudolph Tanzi (Soscia et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 8686]
In both rodent and nematode models, the
authors reported the antimicrobial properties of the Aβ peptide. 

[CHUNK 8687]
Transgenic mice expressing the
human mutant form of APP were infected with Salmonella enterica; the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans expressing the human Aβ42 peptide were infected with Candida albicans. 

[CHUNK 8688]
The mice and C.
elegans expressing the Aβ peptide survived longer than did the control group without Aβ expression
after infection. 

[CHUNK 8689]
In another Aβ-overexpressing mouse model, S. typhimurium injection in the brain
resulted in the induction of Aβ amyloid deposits with an extended survival rate. 

[CHUNK 8690]
These studies

[CHUNK 8691]
Giridharan et al.


[CHUNK 8692]
Infection-Induced AD Pathology
also suggested that Aβ oligomerization, which is considered a
pathological development in the context of neurodegeneration,
may be a necessary step to potentiate the antimicrobial activity
of the peptide (Kumar et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 8693]
These results raised some
important questions about the association between AD and
microbial infection. 

[CHUNK 8694]
The authors also unveiled the mechanism
by which Aβ elicits its antimicrobial property. 

[CHUNK 8695]
Aβ binds to a
microbe and entraps it by forming amyloid ﬁbrils. 

[CHUNK 8696]
The presence
of microbes serves as an eﬃcient surface for nucleation of
amyloid aggregates, thereby raising the possibility of amyloid
deposition (Golde, 2016) (Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 8697]
Thus, brain infection in
a mouse model of AD triggered formation of Aβ plaques
earlier than they usually developed. 

[CHUNK 8698]
The above reports on
neuroinﬂammation-mediated neurodegeneration and the role of
Aβ as an antimicrobial agent have impelled the emanation of
the “antimicrobial protection hypothesis” (Moir et al., 2018) in
addition to diﬀerent hypotheses concerning development of AD,
including the cholinergic hypothesis, amyloid hypothesis, tau
hypothesis and inﬂammatory hypothesis (Du et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8699]
Even
so, the ﬁndings raise the question of how the protective function
of Aβ fails. 

[CHUNK 8700]
The possible answer is microglial dysfunction;
accumulation of biologically active peptides following an
infection might have not been eﬀectively cleared by microglia
in the brain of patients with AD (Stilling and Cryan, 2016)
(Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 8701]
Additionally, Aβ accumulation in the brain may act
as an early toxic event in the pathogenesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 8702]
The Aβ
monomers, soluble and probably nontoxic, would aggregate into
diﬀerent complex assemblies, including soluble oligomers and
protoﬁbrils, with various degrees of toxicity. 

[CHUNK 8703]
That may spread
throughout the brain, and eventually developed into insoluble
amyloid ﬁbrils further assembled into amyloid plaques, which are
one of the characteristic histological lesions on AD brains. 

[CHUNK 8704]
In the
context of AD, the biological signiﬁcance of Aβ conformational
states is important as the diﬀerent types of assemblies might
diﬀerentially inﬂuence the development of neurodegenerative
stages (Miklossy, 2011; Tycko, 2015; Chen et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8705]
Hence,
it would be extremely important to gain knowledge on Aβ
conformational changes following infection that potentially aﬀect
the central nervous system (CNS).


[CHUNK 8706]
Recently,
the
results
from
three
diﬀerent
groups
of
investigators
demonstrated
that
sepsis,
a
life-threatening
acute organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host immune
response after infection, induces systemic inﬂammation that
exacerbates the accumulation of Aβ and triggers AD progression.


[CHUNK 8707]
A study by Gasparotto et al. 

[CHUNK 8708]
reported that sepsis induction in a
cecal ligation and perforation model escalated the levels of Aβ,
p-tau protein and receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE) markers with simultaneous cognitive impairment in
wild-type rats. 

[CHUNK 8709]
The increase in AD markers was accompanied
by activation of microglia and astrocytes (Gasparotto et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 8710]
Another study by Wang et al. 

[CHUNK 8711]
demonstrated that the
induction of sepsis in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxemia
model upregulated the levels of soluble monomeric Aβ (1–42)
and p-tau. 

[CHUNK 8712]
The levels of the inﬂammatory markers, interleukin
(IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cortical
microglial density, increased after systemic injection of LPS
(Wang et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8713]
The third study by Ehler et al. 

[CHUNK 8714]
demonstrated
staining of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the post septic
rat brain after experimental sepsis induction by fecal peritonitis,
and demonstrated staining for β-APP in the postmortem
septic brain (Ehler et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8715]
Together, all of these reports
suggest that inﬂammation is a cardinal component of the
pathophysiology of sepsis. 

[CHUNK 8716]
Thus, the role of inﬂammation might
be associated with the long-term cognitive impairment observed
in sepsis survivors.


[CHUNK 8717]
A compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) is one of the
consequences after bacterial and viral infections, which leads
to diﬀuse cerebral dysfunction after the systemic inﬂammatory
response, with or without direct CNS infection (Cain et al.,
2017; Al-Obaidi and Desa, 2018). 

[CHUNK 8718]
Increased BBB permeability
drives signiﬁcant alteration in consciousness, facilitating the
storm of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in the CNS that leads
to brain dysfunction. 

[CHUNK 8719]
Infection-induced systemic inﬂammation
provokes microbiome dysbiosis in response to pathogenic
microorganisms and/or as a result of altered immune function.


[CHUNK 8720]
Altered immune function after infection acutely exacerbates the
peripheral load of cytokines. 

[CHUNK 8721]
The systemic inﬂammation-induced
BBB breach escalates the transportation of a number of pro-
and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines to the brain,
including TNF-α, IL-1β, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-
β), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) (Semmler
et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 8722]
An increased level of the systemic inﬂammatory
marker TNF-α was demonstrated to be associated with an
increase in cognitive decline in AD patients (Holmes et al.,
2009). 

[CHUNK 8723]
Recent reports demonstrate that in a Drosophila model,
Enterobacteriaceae family infection exacerbates the progression
of AD by promoting immune hemocyte migration to the brain
(Wu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8724]
Additionally, polymicrobial infection-induced
RAGE accumulation facilitates the transport of the Aβ peptide
across the BBB and increases the central Aβ load (Gasparotto
et al., 2018) (Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 8725]
Therefore, endothelial activation followed
by BBB alteration modulates the transport of potential neurotoxic
components from the peripheral circulation to the cerebral
compartment, which facilitates the neuroinﬂammatory cascade
of AD.


[CHUNK 8726]
Recent evidence from both preclinical and clinical studies
suggests the activation of microglia after CNS infection by
viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites (Rock et al., 2004; Ashraf
et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8727]
Microglia, an indicator of brain inﬂammation, have
multiple facets for neuroinﬂammation, including cytotoxicity,
repair, regeneration, and immunosuppression, due to their
ability to acquire diverse activation states or phenotypes
(Chhor et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 8728]
During infection, microglia express
immunoreceptors (IRs), which are capable of recognizing foreign
molecules and triggering innate immune responses. 

[CHUNK 8729]
Pattern-
recognition receptors (PRRs), one of the examples of IRs, are
the central components of the innate immune system that
recognize danger signals, such as invading bacteria, and initiate
the immune response. 

[CHUNK 8730]
PRRs recognize conserved pathogen
molecular structures, commonly known as pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), and intracellular molecules released
from damaged host cells, collectively known as damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (Linnartz and Neumann,
2013).

cluster of diﬀerentiation (CD)14, and purine receptors (P2X7).


[CHUNK 8739]
The biologically active Aβ binds to these receptors and
upregulates the Aβ load in the CNS. 

[CHUNK 8740]
A recent systematic
review and meta-analysis concluded that inhibition of RAGE,
a danger signal that triggers the inﬂammatory response,
improves outcomes after systemic inﬂammation in animal
models (Zhao et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8741]
Intriguingly, the study by Keren-
Shaul et al. 

[CHUNK 8742]
identiﬁed an unexpected population of microglia
called disease-associated microglia (DAM) using single-cell
RNA sequencing technology and demonstrated its signiﬁcance
relevant to AD pathology (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 8743]
A recent
report revealed that pro-inﬂammatory microglia secrete IL-
1α, TNF, and C1q, and these cytokines are suﬃcient to
activate astrocytes termed A1 reactive astrocytes. 

[CHUNK 8744]
The A1-reactive
astrocytes produce complement components that release toxic
factors that, in turn, damage neurons, and oligodendrocytes,
thereby contributing to the cognitive decline (Clarke et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 8745]
To understand how infection induces brain dysfunction,
deep insights into brain-immune cross talk are required,
which can be achieved by identifying the role of DAM and
reactive astrocytes after infection. 

[CHUNK 8746]
Together, all these ﬁndings
support the “inﬂammation hypothesis of AD” that seems more
relevant to the development of the sporadic form of the
disease than to the familial form (Krstic and Knuesel, 2013)
(Figure 1).


[CHUNK 8747]
Inﬂammation is a complex biological response of the immune
system to harmful stimuli caused by chemical, physical, and
biological factors. 

[CHUNK 8748]
Although not only triggered by infection,
inﬂammation secondary to infection plays a key role in the
etiopathogenesis of AD progression (Ashraf et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 8749]
Infection-induced systemic inﬂammation is characterized by
acute or chronic activation of a dysregulated host immune
response, and the signals are not only restricted locally but also
have potential systemic eﬀects (Thorburn et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 8750]
C-reactive
protein (CRP) is an important component of the innate immune
system that is also used as a biomarker of inﬂammation (Kuo
et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 8751]
The levels of this acute-phase reactant are elevated
in bacterial and viral infections (Hu et al., 2017; Vasileva and
Badawi, 2019). 

[CHUNK 8752]
Many population-based prospective studies have
suggested the association of CRP levels with the development
of cognitive decline, especially AD (Duong et al., 1998; McGeer
et al., 2000).


[CHUNK 8753]
During the past decade, several studies have documented
the possible contribution of peripheral infection and the role
of peripheral immune activation in the progression of AD
pathology (Kamer et al., 2008; Cao and Zheng, 2018; Choi et al.,
2019). 

[CHUNK 8754]
Inﬁltrating peripheral myeloid cells participate in Aβ
clearance, as well as in replacing ablated microglia, to adopt a
microglia-like phenotype in the brain with limited phagocytic
capacity (Cao and Zheng, 2018). 

[CHUNK 8755]
A recent study demonstrated
that oral Porphyromonas gingivalis infection in a rodent model
exacerbated the production Aβ1−42. 

[CHUNK 8756]
The same pathogen was also
identiﬁed in AD patients brain (Dominy et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 8757]
Thus, the
prominent molecular and cellular changes in the periphery might
have signiﬁcant role in AD progression (Abbayya et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 8758]
Nevertheless, the Aβ clearance after an infection remains a
largely unexplored area. 

[CHUNK 8759]
Knowing the fact that infection followed
by systemic inﬂammation is sometimes accompanied by organ
dysfunction, liver and kidney dysfunction need to be considered
(Fujishima, 2016). 

[CHUNK 8760]
However, the liver and kidney are the primary
organs involved in the elimination of peripheral Aβ peptide.


[CHUNK 8761]
Thus, the major question remains: what is the fate of Aβ
after infection? 

[CHUNK 8762]
To answer this question, it would be necessary
to gain a deeper insight into the post infection pathway of
Aβ clearance.


[CHUNK 8763]
Systemic
inﬂammation
induced
by
diﬀerent
infectious
etiologies
supports
the
amyloid
hypothesis,
inﬂammatory
hypothesis, and antimicrobial hypothesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 8764]
Thus, the
accumulated knowledge, views and hypotheses from recent
ﬁndings explains the infectious origin as one of the risk
factors of AD progression. 

[CHUNK 8765]
Although the molecular cascade
that links systemic inﬂammation and neuroinﬂammation is
still enigmatic, the possible modules that occur after infection,
which lead to long-term impairment and brain dysfunction that
ultimately trigger AD pathology, may include the following:
Invading microorganisms escalate the peripheral Aβ load, a
necessary step to neutralize and eliminate the pathogen from
the peripheral environment. 

[CHUNK 8766]
The peripherally produced Aβ and
cytokines enter the CNS as systemic inﬂammation is able to
increase BBB permeability.

Since ﬁrst described in the early 1900s, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has risen exponentially
in prevalence and concern. 

[CHUNK 9067]
Research still drives to understand the etiology and
pathogenesis of this disease and what risk factors can attribute to AD. 

[CHUNK 9068]
With a majority
of AD cases being of sporadic origin, the increasing exponential growth of an aged
population and a lack of treatment, it is imperative to discover an easy accessible
preventative method for AD. 

[CHUNK 9069]
Some risk factors can increase the propensity of AD such
as aging, sex, and genetics. 

[CHUNK 9070]
Moreover, there are also modiﬁable risk factors—in terms
of treatable medical conditions and lifestyle choices—that play a role in developing AD.


[CHUNK 9071]
These risk factors have their own biological mechanisms that may contribute to AD
etiology and pathological consequences. 

[CHUNK 9072]
In this review article, we will discuss modiﬁable
risk factors and discuss the current literature of how each of these factors interplay into
AD development and progression and if strategically analyzed and treated, could aid in
protection against this neurodegenerative disease.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s dementia is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by several
neuropathological
markers
including
extracellular
amyloid-β
(Aβ)
plaques,
intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), inflammation, synaptic impairment, and neuronal loss that
leads to cognitive impairment (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010). 

[CHUNK 9074]
A multitude of studies has shown
strong evidence for the concept that the misfolding, aggregation and brain accumulation of protein
aggregates are a triggering event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and responsible
for the subsequent pathological alterations that lead to the clinical disease (Moreno-Gonzalez and
Soto, 2011). 

[CHUNK 9075]
Due to the progressive aging of the population, the number of people affected by AD in
the United States is predicted to reach 14 million by the year 2050 (Mebane-Sims and Alzheimer’s
Association, 2009). 

[CHUNK 9076]
Nowadays, there is not a definitive cure for this disease. 

[CHUNK 9077]
Treatment and daily
care of AD patients are considered costly in emotional and economical aspects. 

[CHUNK 9078]
Available drugs
used to treat AD are expensive, and they focus only to alleviate symptoms that are invariably fatal.


[CHUNK 9079]
The etiology of sporadic AD—more than 95% of cases—is not completely understood. 

[CHUNK 9080]
The lack of
knowledge about sporadic AD etiology makes it very difficult to prevent its onset and detect risk
factors. 

[CHUNK 9081]
Although the avoidance or prevention of modifiable risk factors may not have full impact
in the future development of the disease, a recent study determined that good lifestyle habits
and management of comorbidities may lead to a lower risk of dementia (Baumgart et al., 2015).

Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
Therefore, identifying potential risk factors may facilitate a
reduction in the burden of people affected by AD. 

[CHUNK 9085]
In this review
article, we will discuss proposed modifiable risk factors for AD,
focusing on their effect on protein aggregation and deposition,
and whether their prevention and control may have a direct
impact in the potential to develop this dementia.


[CHUNK 9086]
COMORBIDITIES
Vascular Diseases
The cerebrovascular network and the neurovascular control
mechanisms have a pivotal role in maintaining the activity and
integrity of the brain by assuring constant blood flow (Iadecola,
2004). 

[CHUNK 9087]
In this process, the neurovascular unit—a specialized
entity of neurons, astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells—has
a crucial function. 

[CHUNK 9088]
Alterations in this vascular system contribute
to a reduction in global cerebral perfusion leading to brain
dysfunction and cognitive impairment (Iadecola, 2013), thereby
introducing the concept of the vascular hypothesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 9089]
In this
hypothesis, vascular pathologies promote the neuropathologic
hallmarks of AD (de la Torre, 2018). 

[CHUNK 9090]
Indeed, vascular risk
factors are critically involved in the progression of dementia
leading the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
to AD (Luchsinger et al., 2005; Li et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 9091]
Less than
10% of demented individuals develop only vascular dementia
(Brenowitz et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9092]
There is a growing body of evidence
that supports the idea of vascular factors as contributors
of the pathological mechanisms of AD. 

[CHUNK 9093]
Epidemiologically,
different risk factors for vascular diseases have been shown
as significant risk factors for AD (Panpalli Ates et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 9094]
It has been suggested that the link between cerebrovascular
disease (CVD) and AD is even much more important than
the influence of aging (Love and Miners, 2016). 

[CHUNK 9095]
Some of
these common risk factors shared between CVD and AD
are hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis,
hypercholesterolemia, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype
(Vijayan and Reddy, 2016).


[CHUNK 9096]
A history of prehypertension and hypertension in midlife
or late in life increases the risk of developing dementia and
enhances the neuropathology of AD (Dickstein et al., 2010;
Gottesman et al., 2017a). 

[CHUNK 9097]
The Honolulu-Asia study revealed
that hypertensive patients showed an abundance of amyloid
plaques and NFTs in the brain and atrophied hippocampus
(Launer et al., 2000). 

[CHUNK 9098]
Furthermore, high blood pressure promotes
atherosclerosis in cerebral arteries, blocking the cerebral blood
supply (Ninomiya et al., 2011), leading to lacunar or cortical
infarcts, and, ultimately, cognitive impairment (Dickstein et al.,
2010). 

[CHUNK 9099]
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), that regulates
blood pressure, is able to degrade Aβ (Hemming and Selkoe,
2005) and the use of anti-hypertensive medications, such as ACE
inhibitors, to reduce the risk to develop AD may in fact lead to
an opposite effect than desired. 

[CHUNK 9100]
However, ACE inhibitors have
been proven to not increase amyloid burden in vivo (Hemming
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 9101]
In humans, ACE inhibitors do not have a beneficial
effect in cognitive impairment either (Peters et al., 2008), but
other antihypertensive treatments may still be helpful to reduce
the risk of AD. 

[CHUNK 9102]
Hence, hypertension could be established as
one of the strongest risk factors for AD. 

[CHUNK 9103]
On the other hand,
it has been proposed that hypertension could be induced by
the action of Aβ before dementia onset—being responsible for
high blood pressure and cerebrovascular impairment (Petrovitch
et al., 2000). 

[CHUNK 9104]
Therefore, hypertension could be just a result
of Aβ accumulation rather than a risk or a combination
of both.


[CHUNK 9105]
Hypertension is the main risk factor for stroke, a phenomenon
that deprives the supply of blood flow to the brain. 

[CHUNK 9106]
In fact, the
severity of stroke is higher in diabetic patients, which increases
the rate of death (Air and Kissela, 2007). 

[CHUNK 9107]
Clinical history of
stroke is associated with a prevalence of dementia, denoted as
post-stroke dementia (Pendlebury and Rothwell, 2009), doubling
the risk of developing AD in the elderly (Sun et al., 2006).


[CHUNK 9108]
Among single or multiple stroke patients, post-stroke dementia is
a common outcome. 

[CHUNK 9109]
Mechanistically, there are several processes
that potentially link AD and stroke. 

[CHUNK 9110]
It has been proposed that
stroke could promote Aβ production, hamper Aβ clearance,
and/or aggravate synaptic and neuronal loss already triggered by
Aβ and tau pathology (Sun et al., 2008; Garcia-Alloza et al., 2011;
Hongpaisan et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 9111]
Heart disease (atrial fibrillation, arrhythmias, or cardiac
arrest) causes a reduction in cerebral perfusion, leading to
nerve cell damage (Kwok et al., 2011), brain dysfunction, and
cognitive decline (Alosco et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9112]
Atrial fibrillation is known
as another risk factor for stroke, increasing the prevalence of
AD and dementia (Ott et al., 1997; Kilander et al., 1998). 

[CHUNK 9113]
The
association between heart failure and cognitive impairment is
supported by the induction of brain hypoxia and neuronal loss
after a hypoperfusion event (Muqtadar et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9114]
In addition,
an elevation in Aβ42 serum levels has been reported following
a cardiac arrest episode, which would also contribute to AD
neuropathology (Zetterberg et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 9115]
Overall, cardiovascular
diseases seem to induce a lack of perfusion/oxygenation in the
brain, leading to cognitive impairment and dementia mediated
by an increase in Aβ levels due to different mechanisms.


[CHUNK 9116]
Although already existing Aβ aggregates can also induce cerebral
perfusion impairment, a history of hypertension, stroke or heart
disease can be considered a risk factor to develop AD.


[CHUNK 9117]
The increased risk of developing AD dementia is also
associated with atherosclerosis, a common vessel disorder in
the elderly. 

[CHUNK 9118]
AD patients show atherosclerosis in the circle of
Willis (cerebral arterial circle at the base of the brain) much
more severe and more frequently than healthy age-matched
controls (Roher et al., 2003), and hypertension can have a role
in promoting this intracranial atherosclerosis. 

[CHUNK 9119]
This intracranial
atherosclerosis reduces the brain blood perfusion and is linked
to an increase in neuritic plaque burden and higher Braak
stage in AD patients (Beach et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 9120]
Cholesterol has
been consistently associated to AD. 

[CHUNK 9121]
High levels of cholesterol
have been linked to increased Aβ levels and greater cognitive
impairment and progression in AD. 

[CHUNK 9122]
Cholesterol seems to impair
Aβ degradation and promote its production (Barbero-Camps
et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9123]
In fact, the use of statins, a cholesterol-lowering
medication, such as simvastatin, has shown to lower the risk of
AD diagnosis particularly in women (Zissimopoulos et al., 2017)

Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
even in ApoE homozygotes (Geifman et al., 2017) and levels of
phospho-tau in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; Li G. et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 9126]
The proposed mechanism is the direct interaction of statins and
Aβ protofibrils (Shakour et al., 2019), inhibition of apoptosis
(Hu et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9127]
Therefore, hypercholesterolemia has been
suggested to be a high-risk factor for AD and cholesterol-
lowering medication should be considered as a preventive
therapy for dementia.


[CHUNK 9128]
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a condition where
Aβ deposits accumulate within the walls of the meningeal
and intracerebral arteries, arterioles, and very rarely, veins
and capillaries. 

[CHUNK 9129]
This engenders a thickening of vessels walls
and
constriction
of
vascular
lumen
thereby
promoting
potential micro-aneurysms. 

[CHUNK 9130]
This pathology increases the risk to
develop hemorrhages, ischemic lesions, and encephalopathies,
resulting in profound cerebral damage that contributes to
neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction (Ellis et al.,
1996; Haglund et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 9131]
CAA is associated to a more rapid
cognitive decline in both demented and non-demented persons
(Pfeifer et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 9132]
Certainly, CAA has a close association
with AD and additive effects on the risk of developing dementia
through AD pathology. 

[CHUNK 9133]
The diagnosis of probable AD is related
to the presence of CAA. 

[CHUNK 9134]
In fact, CAA is highly prevalent in
AD patients, being present in about 80%–90% of AD patients
(Arvanitakis et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 9135]
Moreover, the role of hypertension
has a significant additional causal factor that contributes to the
progression of CAA-related vasculopathies.


[CHUNK 9136]
Other CVDs have been described in the aging and AD
brain supporting that cerebrovascular dysfunction contributes
to neurodegeneration, cognitive dysfunction, and lowers the
threshold for developing AD dementia. 

[CHUNK 9137]
These cerebrovascular
pathologies
are
cortical
infarcts,
lacunes,
hemorrhages,
microbleeds,
intracranial
small
vessel
atherosclerosis-
arteriosclerosis, and blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction
(Toledo et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9138]
Generally, a higher number and the extent
of cortical infarcts is directly associated with a higher risk of
dementia. 

[CHUNK 9139]
Extensive CAA and cerebral small vessel disease have
also been proposed to contribute to neurodegeneration in AD
(Toledo et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9140]
Likewise, numerous microbleeds contribute
to cognitive function decline and severe white matter lesions that
lead to a 4-fold increased risk of developing MCI (Benedictus
et al., 2015) that can eventually lead to AD development.


[CHUNK 9141]
Regarding the effect of CVD on protein misfolding and
deposition, there is a greater tendency of amyloid accumulation
in patients with vascular risk factors (Langbaum et al., 2012;
Gottesman et al., 2017b). 

[CHUNK 9142]
Vascular insufficiency results in
hypoperfusion and hypoxia that activate the amyloid precursor
protein (APP) cleavage enzyme β-secretase (Xu et al., 2007) and
facilitates a robust deposition of fibrillar amyloid. 

[CHUNK 9143]
Therefore, Aβ
not only promotes cerebrovascular dysregulation increasing the
brain susceptibility to ischemia but also ischemia upregulates
Aβ cleavage and its accumulation. 

[CHUNK 9144]
On the other hand, the main
Aβ clearance mechanisms are altered and damaged under the
presence of vascular dysfunction contributing to parenchymal
and vascular accumulation of Aβ (Garcia-Alloza et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 9145]
Tau hyperphosphorylation and NFTs are also associated with
vascular risk and the synergistic effect of elevated Aβ burden
(Vemuri et al., 2017; Rabin et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 9146]
It has been also
described that increased plasma levels of Aβ are linked to
vascular disease both in the brain (white matter lesions and
microbleeds) and in the periphery (hypertension, diabetes and
ischemic heart disease; Janelidze et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9147]
It should be
noted that the contributions of vascular dysfunction occur at
the early stages of AD pathophysiology and may represent a
casual pathway towards dementia, facilitating an earlier diagnosis
of AD. 

[CHUNK 9148]
Furthermore, the vascular component is a promising
target to decrease the risk of dementia and the neuropathological
progression of AD. 

[CHUNK 9149]
Nonetheless, further studies are required
to elucidate the mechanisms underlying vascular pathologies
as they relate to AD and dementia. 

[CHUNK 9150]
This, along with the
development of precise vascular biomarkers will be fundamental
to discover new ways to prevent and treat AD and related
dementias. 

[CHUNK 9151]
Therefore, the improvement in the vascular health
and the control of vascular risk factors may reduce the risk of
developing vascular pathologies that trigger AD neuropathology.


[CHUNK 9152]
Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes is estimated to affect over 30.3 million people with
over 7.2 million undiagnosed, and 90%–95% of these cases are
delineated as type 2 diabetes (T2D; Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2017). 

[CHUNK 9153]
T2D is a complex metabolic disorder
that is characterized prominently by hyperinsulinemia, insulin
resistance, glucose metabolism impairments, and, ultimately,
pancreatic β-cell destruction. 

[CHUNK 9154]
In T2D, pancreatic β-cells secrete
excessive insulin in response to insulin resistance causing
hyperinsulinemia, while allowing blood glucose levels (BGLs) to
be maintained. 

[CHUNK 9155]
As this continues over time, it begins to burden
the β-cells, leading to insulin insufficiency and finally causing
T2D. 

[CHUNK 9156]
T2D and AD have a strong epidemiological link—so
substantial that some researchers define AD as type 3 diabetes.


[CHUNK 9157]
T2D is proposed to increase the risk of AD and dementia from
1.3 up to 5.5 times and the Rotterdam study in the 1990s
described T2D having double the risk for AD and dementia (Ott
et al., 1999; Li et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 9158]
T2D patients are at ∼60% greater
risk for the development of dementia compared with individuals
without diabetes (Chatterjee et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9159]
Additional evidence
of a systematic analysis concluded that T2D is convincingly a
major risk factor for AD and vascular dementia (Bellou et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 9160]
There are simultaneous influences within each of these
diseases that also adjoin T2D and AD, such as progressing
age, diet, body mass index (BMI) and obesity, and sedentary
lifestyle. 

[CHUNK 9161]
In fact, adiposity, being overweight, or obese is a
chief cause for insulin resistance (Luchsinger and Gustafson,
2009). 

[CHUNK 9162]
There is a strong epidemiological link for T2D and AD
and this may be due to their shared pathological mechanisms
(Baglietto-Vargas et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 9163]
Hyperinsulinemia has been associated with AD risk as
indicated by such studies as the Honoulu-Asia Aging study
(Luchsinger and Gustafson, 2009). 

[CHUNK 9164]
Other than regulating the
peripheral metabolism, insulin has insulin receptors expressed
throughout the central nervous system (CNS). 

[CHUNK 9165]
The function of
brain insulin receptors is not clearly understood. 

[CHUNK 9166]
It is known
to regulate circuit function and plasticity by controlling synapse
density and plays a role in the cholinergic system.

Edwards et al.


[CHUNK 9169]
Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
in insulin receptors and hyperinsulinemia have been associated
with aging and AD. 

[CHUNK 9170]
A decreased level in insulin receptors
and their sensitivity in AD patients compared to middle-aged
controls and expression and metabolism of Aβ and tau are
also affected (Frölich et al., 1998; Sims-Robinson et al., 2010).


[CHUNK 9171]
Moreover, irregular insulin levels can disrupt the cholinergic
system, which is also compromised in AD, as insulin aids in
stimulating choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; Rivera et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 9172]
Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is vital for the degradation of
insulin and Aβ. 

[CHUNK 9173]
Thus, hyperinsulinemia can lead to a competition
of insulin and Aβ for IDE, thereby increasing amyloid levels
in the brain. 

[CHUNK 9174]
Loss-of-function mutations of IDE in rodents
exhibit glucose intolerance and accruement of Aβ aggregates,
whereas, IDE action revealed opposite results (Shen et al.,
2006). 

[CHUNK 9175]
Downstream insulin signaling pathways are also affected.


[CHUNK 9176]
Pathways that are known to be involved in AD pathogenesis such
as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B
(Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) are altered due
to insulin dysregulation. 

[CHUNK 9177]
MAPK expression is correlated with Aβ
production and NFTs and is increased in AD patients. 

[CHUNK 9178]
Under
insulin resistance, Akt signaling can inhibit GSK-3β, which
dephosphorylates and activates glycogen synthase in glycogenesis
and ultimately resulting in the hyperphosphorylation of tau.


[CHUNK 9179]
Accordingly, the cognitive impairment that is noted in both
T2D and AD could be intervened by insulin administration.


[CHUNK 9180]
Tied to insulin issues is the dysfunction of glucose metabolism.


[CHUNK 9181]
The brain is estimated to consume 20% of energy stored in
the body, and neurons depend on a steady peripheral transport
of glucose through the BBB facilitated by glucose transporters
(GLUTs), especially GLUT-1 and -3. 

[CHUNK 9182]
Deficiency in GLUT-1
and -3 is reported in AD brains, and this decrease correlated
to the decrease in O-GlcNAcylation, hyperphosphorylation of
tau, and to the density of NFTs (Liu et al., 2008, 2009).


[CHUNK 9183]
Indeed, imaging techniques such as Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-
PET imaging are able to detect glucose metabolism alterations
in AD related to anatomical areas associated with pathology
and preceding cognitive impairments (Ballard et al., 2011;
Nordberg, 2015).


[CHUNK 9184]
Both AD and T2D are diseases related to protein misfolding
and aggregation (Soto, 2003; Moreno-Gonzalez and Soto,
2011; Morales et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9185]
In T2D, the aggregation of an
amyloidogenic protein called islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) or
amylin is seen in up to 96% of T2D patients in pancreatic β-cells
(Clark et al., 1995; Westermark, 2011). 

[CHUNK 9186]
IAPP is a hydrophobic
hormone co-secreted with insulin into blood circulation at
1:100 ratio. 

[CHUNK 9187]
It contributes to glycemic control by slowing down
gastric emptying and inhibiting digestive secretion and other
pancreatic hormones. 

[CHUNK 9188]
Although it is not clear that IAPP is a
cause or an effect of T2D, amyloidogenic IAPP aggregates are
toxic and have been proposed to destroy β-cells and facilitate
the progression of the disease (Westermark, 2011; Abedini et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 9189]
In fact, genetically modified rodent models expressing
human IAPP demonstrate aggressive diabetic-like phenotype,
such as insulin impairments and hyperglycemia, with IAPP
deposits and β-cell loss (Clark et al., 1995; Janson et al.,
1996). 

[CHUNK 9190]
Interestingly, IAPP has been discovered in AD brains,
whereas Aβ and tau have been found in T2D pancreas; in
addition, these proteins were seen to co-localize in brain and
pancreas (Miklossy et al., 2010; Valente et al., 2010; Moreno-
Gonzalez et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9191]
Moreover, T2D patients display increased
amounts of NFTs and Aβ in the hippocampus (Miklossy et al.,
2010). 

[CHUNK 9192]
In AD patients, there is an extensive prevalence of
IAPP compared to non-AD (Janson et al., 2004). 

[CHUNK 9193]
Brain of
T2D/AD patients show an augmented number of cortical Aβ
plaques and tau-positive cells compared to affected AD brains
suggesting that T2D/AD patients have a more severe pathology
with much more rapid progression (Bretherton-Watt and Bloom,
1991). 

[CHUNK 9194]
Therefore, these amyloidogenic proteins may interact
directly. 

[CHUNK 9195]
IAPP [8–18] and IAPP [22–28] sequences were noted
hot regions for IAPP and Aβ40 interaction (Kapurniotu et al.,
2010). 

[CHUNK 9196]
One proposed mechanism is the cross-seeding of Aβ
and IAPP when oligomers composed by one protein seed the
aggregation of a different protein by a seeding-nucleation process
(Morales et al., 2013; Jucker and Walker, 2015; Moreno-Gonzalez
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9197]
Many studies reveal a successful heterologous
seeding aggregation when both proteins are present in vitro
(Berhanu et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014; Moreno-Gonzalez et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 9198]
Double transgenic mice overexpressing both Aβ in brain
and IAPP in pancreas show increased Aβ burden compared
to controls (Moreno-Gonzalez et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9199]
IAPP pancreatic
homogenate injected into an AD mouse model provided a
potent seeding effect by accelerating AD pathology and impairing
memory (Moreno-Gonzalez et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9200]
Independently of the
mechanism of action, T2D can be considered one of the main
risk factors for AD.


[CHUNK 9201]
Traumatic Brain Injury
Recent research has posited that traumatic brain injury (TBI)
is a robust factor that leads to the advancement of AD or
dementia. 

[CHUNK 9202]
The severity of TBI is quantified by the Glascow Coma
Scale (GCS). 

[CHUNK 9203]
Severe TBI (sTBI) represents head injuries that
result in permanent or an extended period of unconsciousness,
amnesia, or death following a head injury with a GCS of 3–8.


[CHUNK 9204]
Moderate TBI involves a period of unconsciousness or amnesia
from 30 min ≥24 h with a GCS of 9–12. 

[CHUNK 9205]
Mild TBI (mTBI) is
recognized as head injuries that cause a brief state of altered
consciousness resulting in ≤30 min of unconsciousness, though
most mTBIs do not result in a loss of consciousness. 

[CHUNK 9206]
mTBI
represents a majority of reported cases and has been linked
to AD pathology (Edwards et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9207]
The harsher the TBI
the greater risk of developing AD (Graves et al., 1990; Guo
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 9208]
World War II veterans that had a TBI event
had an increased risk of developing AD (Plassman et al.,
2000). 

[CHUNK 9209]
After a TBI event, dementia diagnosis was found to
be strongest within the first year (4–6 times) but maintained
significance up to 30 years (Nordström and Nordström, 2018).


[CHUNK 9210]
In a large cohort study, the overall risk of dementia in
individuals with a history of TBI was 24% higher than those
without a history of TBI. 

[CHUNK 9211]
A sTBI increased AD risk by 35%
and a single mTBI or concussion increased the risk by 17%.


[CHUNK 9212]
The risk of dementia was increased with the number of TBI
events—33% higher for two or three TBIs, 61% higher for
four TBIs, and 183% higher for five or more TBIs (Fann
et al., 2018), demonstrating the link between TBI severity

Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease

[CHUNK 9215]
TBI begins with
an instant, irreversible initial blow or impact causing direct
damage to the surrounding neuronal and astroglial cells and
vasculature. 

[CHUNK 9216]
Primary insult can either be a focal injury or
diffuse axonal injury (DAI). 

[CHUNK 9217]
The impact can trigger a rapid
necrosis due to the mechanical damage, edema, increased
intracranial pressure, and ischemia. 

[CHUNK 9218]
This will secondarily lead
to neuronal excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative
stress, inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, axonal degeneration,
neuronal death, and, ultimately, instigating cognitive and
behavioral impairments (Gentleman et al., 2004; Breunig et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 9219]
Therefore, TBI shares many of the molecular mechanisms
observed in AD. 

[CHUNK 9220]
Following TBI, multiple cell death pathways
get activated leading to synapsis reduction and finally neuronal
loss as loss of total brain volume in the hippocampus, cortex
and other medial temporal lobe structures, and elevation in
ventricular volume has been described (Blennow et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 9221]
This neurodegenerative process initiated by TBI may trigger
the development of memory problems that may then convert
into AD.


[CHUNK 9222]
Numerous
in
vivo
studies
demonstrate
Aβ
and
tau
pathophysiology along with other pathological consequences
alike to AD following TBI. 

[CHUNK 9223]
Aβ plaques are reported in up to
30% of post-mortem TBI patients. 

[CHUNK 9224]
Aβ can accumulate rapidly
following TBI, reported as early as 2–4 h (Graham et al., 1996).


[CHUNK 9225]
Plaque formation is described as diffuse plaques seen in early-
stage AD and seen in all ages, even children, but determined
to be more robust in elderly affected individuals (Johnson
et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9226]
Post-mortem TBI brains show greater Aβ density
compared to age-matched controls years following injury
(Johnson et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9227]
Notably, Aβ42 is seen to be the major type
following a TBI event in brain and CSF (Breunig et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 9228]
Interestingly, Aβ can accumulate in the white matter following
TBI, unlike AD where it is more prominent in gray matter. 

[CHUNK 9229]
It
is described that the key constituents that generate Aβ (APP,
β-secretase, and γ-secretase) anomalously colocalize at swollen
and disconnected axonal bulb sites, producing and releasing Aβ
into the brain parenchyma (Chen et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 9230]
Repetitive mTBI
is associated to other tauopathies, especially to chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE). 

[CHUNK 9231]
NFT pathology was found in 8 out of 27
post-mortem TBI brains (Smith et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 9232]
In fact, widespread
NFTs are present in up to a third of patients following survival of
a year or more from a single TBI (Johnson et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9233]
Tau levels
in CSF from TBI patients expressed over a 1,000-fold increase
compared to various neurological-diseased and non-diseased
individuals (Zemlan et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 9234]
Alterations of multiple protein
kinases and phosphatases, neurofilament proteins, APP, BACE1,
and even aggregated α-synuclein have been also found after TBI
(Uryu et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 9235]
Therefore, TBI induces disease processes
that may accelerate the formation and aggregation of misfolded
proteins, possibly through axonal damage, and perhaps building
upon the pathogenesis of AD.


[CHUNK 9236]
Epilepsy
Epilepsy can be defined as a neurological disorder where there
is a continual and spontaneous propensity to have seizure
activity as convulsions or non-convulsions due to abnormal
neural firing and networks. 

[CHUNK 9237]
Genes, developmental mechanisms,
injury insult, and neuronal plasticity are thought to play chief
roles in epilepsy (Scharfman, 2007). 

[CHUNK 9238]
The convoluted functional
neuronal network imbalances in epilepsy can ultimately result in
neuropathological changes, brain atrophy, and cognitive decline
(Friedman et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9239]
It is not known if epileptic seizures
are a cause or an effect of AD, but certainly, they both share
mutual molecular and cellular mechanisms (Bazil, 2003). 

[CHUNK 9240]
MCI
and early-stage AD patients with epileptic activity show earlier
onset of AD and accelerated rate of cognitive decline (Vossel
et al., 2013, 2016; Cretin et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9241]
On the other hand,
multiple studies indicate that AD patients have an elevated risk of
developing seizures or epilepsy (Vossel et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9242]
Indeed, the
pervasiveness of seizures is about 7–8 fold higher in individuals
with AD than individuals without dementia (Amatniek et al.,
2006). 

[CHUNK 9243]
Additional studies posit that the younger the age of
dementia onset is correlated to increased seizure risk, as well
as the severity or stage of AD, has a parallel relationship with
seizure (Horvath et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9244]
Seizures are commonly described
in cases of familial AD and strongly related to Down syndrome
cases. 

[CHUNK 9245]
Thus, epileptic seizures could be an early event in AD
progression or an integral part of AD severity. 

[CHUNK 9246]
However, more
studies are needed as a systemic database meta-analysis between
dementia and epilepsy concluded significant gaps of knowledge
in epidemiology between the two disorders with insufficient data
to pool an overall incidence rate.


[CHUNK 9247]
Central neural circuits maintain a mean firing rate related
to constant, spontaneous neuronal activity, which is dependent
on intrinsic circuit excitability, and their synaptic properties and
functional connectome. 

[CHUNK 9248]
Firing instability and limited synapse
flexibility at early AD stages trigger a vicious cycle and
dysregulation of an integrated homeostatic network (Frere and
Slutsky, 2018). 

[CHUNK 9249]
Firing rates also can be dependent on the balance
of excitation and inhibition ratio, and its imbalance could play
a role in AD and epilepsy. 

[CHUNK 9250]
Hyperexcitability can be triggered by
the mismanagement of glutamate levels and Ca2+ homeostasis
in the brain. 

[CHUNK 9251]
Glial cells could also play a role in hyperexcitability
and seizures as induced seizures are shown to excite astrocytes
directly by stimulating the release of glial glutamate (Ding et al.,
2007). 

[CHUNK 9252]
Phase-coupling of oscillations in the brain is central for
normal brain function. 

[CHUNK 9253]
Gamma oscillations (30–150 Hz) are
known to increase locally for sensory processing and memory
encoding, while other oscillations would be reduced accordingly,
such as alpha, beta, and theta. 

[CHUNK 9254]
AD patients exhibit reductions in
gamma power oscillations. 

[CHUNK 9255]
Pharmacological inhibition of gamma
oscillations leads to augmented epileptic activity in experimental
animals (Maheshwari et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9256]
Gamma oscillations can
be increased by social interactions and mental stimulation;
therefore, these activities have been suggested as a preventative
measure in AD development. 

[CHUNK 9257]
Antiepileptic treatments, such as
levetiracetam, reverse neural network impairments and behavior
(Sanchez et al., 2012), decrease brain dysrhythmia (Das et al.,
2018), and improves cognition in animal models and MCI
patients (Bakker et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 9258]
A plethora of AD transgenic animal models reveals stochastic
epileptiform.

Aβ
can
affect

N-Methyl-D-

pathways (Corbett et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9263]
In APP23xPS45 mice, neuronal
hyperexcitability occurs before any Aβ plaque deposition.


[CHUNK 9264]
Inhibition of oligomeric Aβ restores neural activity while
inoculation of oligomeric Aβ in wild-type mice induces
hyperexcitability (Busche et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 9265]
AD Tg mice also reveal
cortical hyperactivity near amyloid plaques due to decreased
GABAergic inhibition. 

[CHUNK 9266]
APP/PS1 mice have early-impaired
GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus and entorhinal
cortex (Ramos et al., 2006; Moreno-Gonzalez et al., 2009;
Baglietto-Vargas et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 9267]
Administration of Aβ suppresses
gamma oscillations in vivo and in vitro (Mucke and Selkoe,
2012). 

[CHUNK 9268]
The chronic presence of Aβ and hyperexcitability effect
could have an indirect effect by exhausting inhibitory neurons
resulting in their deterioration. 

[CHUNK 9269]
On the contrary, vulnerable
neural networks produced by epileptogenic episodes could aid
in the triggering of Aβ plaques. 

[CHUNK 9270]
Chronic neural stimulation
promotes amyloid deposition and elicits epileptic activity
in an AD mouse model (Yamamoto et al., 2015), as well as
increasing firing rate has been noted to surge Aβ production
(Kamenetz et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 9271]
Tau protein could play a much
larger role in neuronal activity and, therefore, epileptiform
activity than previously thought. 

[CHUNK 9272]
Epileptic patients present
elevated levels of total tau in CSF (Monti et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 9273]
In fact,
pharmacologically induced epilepsy in 3xTg-AD mice leads to
elevated hyperphosphorylated tau levels in the dentate granule
cells and mossy fibers (Yan et al., 2012), indicating the effect of
epileptic activity in tau misfolding and aggregation. 

[CHUNK 9274]
Moreover,
synaptic activity can stimulate the release of tau and spreading of
tau pathology, induce tau phosphorylation, and relocate tau to
the dendritic spines (Khan et al., 2014; Frandemiche et al., 2014;
Wu et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9275]
On the other hand, reduction of tau protein
levels prevents cognitive decline, synaptic impairment, and
spontaneous epileptiform activity in several APP mouse models
(Roberson et al., 2011; de Calignon et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9276]
A152T tau
transgenic mice present abnormal brain oscillations (Das et al.,
2018), suggesting a mutual effect of epileptic activity and tau
aggregation. 

[CHUNK 9277]
Nevertheless, future studies are needed to elucidate
epileptiform activity in the etiology and progression of AD;
however, current research dictates a strong relationship between
epilepsy and AD.


[CHUNK 9278]
Depression
Depression, also termed major depressive disorder, is a serious
medical illness with a wide range of mental health issues that
affects about 300 million people worldwide (World Health
Organization, 2017). 

[CHUNK 9279]
This disease is characterized by feelings of
sadness and loss of interest in ordinary things. 

[CHUNK 9280]
A common triad
of symptoms seen include anhedonia, low energy or fatigue, and
a low or depressed mood. 

[CHUNK 9281]
Depression is a common symptom
seen in people suffering from AD (Drevets and Rubin, 1989;
Lyketsos et al., 1996). 

[CHUNK 9282]
There is a debate whether depression is
a risk factor for developing AD, rather than just a symptom.


[CHUNK 9283]
Recently, several clinical studies bolstered the idea of depressive
symptoms as a crucial risk factor for cognitive decline and AD.


[CHUNK 9284]
It has been shown that the age of onset for AD is expedited
in MCI patients with a history of depression (de Oliveira
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 9285]
In fact, there is a strong association between
depression and AD onset (Barnes et al., 2012; Steenland et al.,
2012). 

[CHUNK 9286]
In addition, a less studied area between depression and
AD is whether the age of onset of depression could lead to
a different pathology of AD. 

[CHUNK 9287]
Early-life depression (ELD) is
characterized as onset before the age of 60 as opposite to late-life
depression (LLD), so there is interest to determine how the
age of onset of depression would influence the progression of
AD. 

[CHUNK 9288]
It remains to be elucidated if depression onset, whether
ELD or LLD, could influence the progression of AD or even
engender disparate pathology in AD. 

[CHUNK 9289]
Large-scale prospective
studies proposed that LLD, but not early or mid-life, increases the
risk of AD (Barnes et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9290]
These findings were confirmed
by a recent meta-analysis study suggesting LLD increases the risk
of AD incidence by 1.65-folds (Diniz et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9291]
Moreover, a
recent study reported elevated Aβ deposition in patients with
a lifetime history of major depression (Li P. et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 9292]
Additionally, individuals with MCI plus coexistent depressive
symptoms have an elevated Aβ load and a higher risk of faster
conversion to AD compared to non-depressed MCI patients
(Hebert et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 9293]
Neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin play a
crucial role in both the development of depression and in AD
pathology (Chen et al., 1996; Jacobsen et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9294]
Serotonin
helps regulate mood, social behavior, and memory, whereas,
dopamine, functions in motor control and reward-motivated
behavior. 

[CHUNK 9295]
Therefore, these two neurotransmitters could be key in
the conversion of depression into AD. 

[CHUNK 9296]
In AD mice, dopaminergic
neuronal loss in the midbrain leads to memory impairment
(Nobili et al., 2017), whereas restoration of dopamine release
improves cognitive dysfunction (Guzman-Ramos et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9297]
In
depression, there is a decrease in dopamine production leading to
a loss of reward-motivated and low levels of serotonin have been
associated with depressive behavior since serotonin regulates
mood and social behavior. 

[CHUNK 9298]
Additionally, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs reduce brain Aβ levels by increasing
serotonin levels in the brain (Nelson et al., 2007).


[CHUNK 9299]
Many factors can lead to the onset of depression, but the
most studied cause is stress (Monroe et al., 2007; Ross et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 9300]
Stress works by activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis leading to the release of glucocorticoid
hormones from the adrenal cortex—cortisol in humans and
corticosterone in rodents (Caruso et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9301]
Rising levels
of cortisol can negatively affect the HPA axis and refrain
it from maintaining its sensitivity and regulating the stress
response. 

[CHUNK 9302]
Increased cortisol levels have been seen in biological
fluids of patients affected by AD (Hatzinger et al., 1995;
Rasmuson et al., 2001; Curto et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9303]
Stress increases
the production of Aβ and enhances the formation of amyloid
plaques by increasing corticotropin-releasing factor release,
which leads to an increase in neuronal activity, stimulating
the production of Aβ, and demonstrating a link between
depression and AD development (Dong and Csernansky, 2009).


[CHUNK 9304]
In addition, stress induces neuronal loss in the hippocampus,
an area known to be one of the earliest regions affected by
AD neuropathology, by increasing glucocorticoid release and

Oral

in the hippocampal region of rats, adding to the idea that
stress triggers directed neurodegeneration (Magariños et al.,
1998). 

[CHUNK 9308]
Recently, patients suffering from LLD presented a faster
hippocampal atrophy rate than those with ELD, eluding that
LLD, and not ELD, leads to a higher risk of developing AD.


[CHUNK 9309]
Therefore, there may be a different progression of the disease
depending on the age of depression onset (Taylor et al., 2014),
and LLD could be considered a risk factor for AD development.


[CHUNK 9310]
The effect of taking antidepressants on AD pathology and
development before the onset of the disease as a preventive
therapy in LLD population remains to be determined.


[CHUNK 9311]
LIFESTYLE
Physical Activity
Under normal circumstances, an elderly individual without
dementia diagnosis will exhibit hippocampal volume shrinkage
of 1%–2% each year (Erickson et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 9312]
Hippocampal
shrinkage may be reversed by a moderate-intensity exercise
training. 

[CHUNK 9313]
A 1-year aerobic exercise intervention was effective at
increasing hippocampal volume by 2% and offsetting normal
decline associated with aging (Erickson et al., 2011) and
individuals with life-long exercise routine reveal larger brain
volume and improved executive function than inactive older
adults (Tseng et al., 2013).

However, the increase in volume
was selective since it only influenced the anterior hippocampus

occurs. 

[CHUNK 9315]
Clinical studies indicate that physical activity may be
neuroprotective by preserving cognition and maintaining the
brain neuroplasticity (Kramer et al., 1999; Winter et al., 2007).


[CHUNK 9316]
In addition to prevention, exercise has shown to have a favorable
outcome on improving cognitive symptoms. 

[CHUNK 9317]
AD patients
performing a moderate exercise program for a year exhibited a
slower decline in the capability to achieve activities of daily living
and amelioration on the physical impairment (Rolland et al.,
2007; Pitkälä et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9318]
Some other studies have also found
that aerobic exercise is able to improve memory performance
and cognitive function in aging, MCI, and AD patients (Baker
et al., 2010; Vidoni et al., 2012; Morris et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9319]
Although
all these studies indicate that exercise may be effective in
reducing the clinical symptoms observed in AD patients, there
are no studies reporting its effect on amyloid deposition and
how physical activity may prevent from developing AD in at
risk population. 

[CHUNK 9320]
In this direction, several studies have intended
to investigate the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive
function and amyloid deposition in AD models. 

[CHUNK 9321]
Streptozotocin-
induced mice where placed on treadmill exercise daily for
30 min for a month. 

[CHUNK 9322]
Afterwards, rats showed a decline in
amyloidogenesis and tauopathy as well as a suppression of
neuroinflammation and oxidative stress leading to selective
anti-inflammatory microglia activation and pro-inflammatory
microglia inhibition, hippocampal neuroprotection, and overall
cognitive preservation (Lu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9323]
In transgenic animal
models of AD, exercise leads to amelioration of behavior
impairment, reduction of Aβ deposition, lager hippocampal
volume and decreased apoptosis (Adlard et al., 2005; Nichol
et al., 2007; Um et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013), especially in
animals under a voluntary exercise routine (Yuede et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 9324]
Enhanced cognitive function was also observed in ApoEε4 mouse
models (Nichol et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 9325]
Likewise, Tau transgenic animals
subjected to forced or voluntary treadmill exercise for several
months show reduced levels of total tau, ptau and insoluble tau,
although it had no neuroprotective effects (Leem et al., 2009;
Belarbi et al., 2011; Ohia-Nwoko et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 9326]
Likewise, exercise
decreases BACE (secretase beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1)
activity and APP levels compared to sedentary rats (Alkadhi
and Dao, 2018). 

[CHUNK 9327]
Regarding neuroprotection, both treadmill and
swimming exercise are able to decrease caspase-3 expression and
revers the Bax to Bcl-2 ratio observed in AD (Jin et al., 2014;
Baek and Kim, 2016). 

[CHUNK 9328]
Treadmill exercise also increases sirtuin-1
(SIRT-1), a modulator of neuronal survival, in a transgenic AD
mouse (Koo et al., 2017) and enhances spatial memory in AD
mice through upregulation of c-Fos, an indicator of neuronal
activity expressed after depolarization (Jee et al., 2008).


[CHUNK 9329]
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serves as a
mediator in neurogenesis as well as dendritic expansion, playing
a vital role in memory formation. 

[CHUNK 9330]
Acute exercise increases
BDNF production in the brain (Neeper et al., 1995; Ferris et al.,
2007). 

[CHUNK 9331]
Modifications in BDNF serum correlate with changes in
the hippocampal volume in MCI and Borba et al. 

[CHUNK 9332]
(2016). 

[CHUNK 9333]
AD
models exposed to treadmill exercise show promotion of cell
proliferation and amelioration of memory impairment observed
by an increase in BDNF and TrkB levels (Liu et al., 2011; Kim
et al., 2014; Sim, 2014). 

[CHUNK 9334]
BDNF also enhances non-amyloidogenic
APP processing by activating α-secretase and, therefore, reducing
the amount of toxic Aβ peptides after voluntary exercise (Nigam
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9335]
A recent report suggests that additional stimulation
of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and increase in BDNF levels
is necessary to induce the cognitive beneficial effect of exercise
(Choi et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9336]
Irisin is a myokine that is also released by
physical exercise (Wrann et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9337]
FNDC5/irisin prevents
the binding of Aβ oligomers to neurons reducing its toxicity
in vitro whereas irisin knockout mice present a deterioration
in long-term potentiation and memory. 

[CHUNK 9338]
In AD brains, irisin
levels are reduced positing this myokine as a mediator of the
beneficial effects of exercise in preventing or reducing the
deleterious effects of AD pathology (Lourenco et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 9339]
Therefore, recent reports suggest that physical activity has a
positive effect on synaptic plasticity, hippocampal shrinkage,
and memory formation in animal models and, moreover, it
can decrease the load of amyloid aggregates. 

[CHUNK 9340]
Studies performed
in AD patients indicate that exercise ameliorate some of
the AD-related clinical symptoms and helps to decrease the
progression of the disease. 

[CHUNK 9341]
It still remains unknown whether
exercise could diminish the risk to develop AD although studies
performed in MCI patients may shed light to its potential benefits
for prevention.


[CHUNK 9342]
Sleep Disturbance
The sleep-wake cycle refers to a 24-h daily sleep pattern, typically
consisting of 16 h of being awake and 8 h of sleep.

Edwards et al.


[CHUNK 9345]
Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
cycle, controlled by the body’s circadian rhythm and sleep
homeostasis, is important to many brain functions and plays a
role in removing toxins from the brain that have accumulated
throughout the day. 

[CHUNK 9346]
A sleep cycle consists of stages N1, N2,
and N3 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep followed by
REM sleep. 

[CHUNK 9347]
During REM sleep, the brain is highly active as it
is being rewired and is considered the most important part of
the sleep-wake cycle. 

[CHUNK 9348]
With aging, the sleep pattern is altered
by a reduction in sleeping time and REM sleep. 

[CHUNK 9349]
Sleep-wake
cycle disturbances, including increased daytime sleep, reduced
nocturnal sleep, and sleep fragmentation, are a common feature
seen in AD patients (Bonanni et al., 2005; Moran et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 9350]
It is well established that in AD patients electroencephalograms
are characteristic of increases in N1 and N2 NREM sleep
and REM latency, and decreases in REM sleep, leading to an
overall decrease in sleep duration (Loewenstein et al., 1982).


[CHUNK 9351]
Recent studies indicate that prolonged sleep duration could
be indicative of at risk population (Westwood et al., 2017)
and, in fact, NREM characteristics may provide evidence of an
already deteriorated cognitive condition (Taillard et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 9352]
Due to the association between aging, cognition and sleep
disorders, it has been proposed that sleep disturbances may
lead to an increased risk for AD development (Roh et al.,
2012). 

[CHUNK 9353]
In fact, disorders in the sleep pattern have been related
to an increased risk to develop cognitive deficiency, including
MCI and dementia (Diem et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9354]
On the other hand,
deposition of Aβ seems to deteriorate sleep efficiency (time
in bed spent asleep), especially during the preclinical stage
(Ju et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 9355]
An increase in the amount of light throughout the
sleep-wake cycle leads to an increase in insoluble tau and
memory impairment since continuous light input suppresses
the production of the hormone melatonin that regulates the
sleep-wake cycle (Di Meco et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 9356]
It has been shown
that sleep increases the rate of Aβ clearance in the brain
through the glymphatic system (Xie et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9357]
In fact, the
interstitial concentration of Aβ was higher in awake humans
when compared to sleeping ones, indicating that wakefulness is
associated with an increased production of Aβ (Bateman et al.,
2006). 

[CHUNK 9358]
The glymphatic system is able to clear waste products
through convective bulk flow of interstitial fluid (ISF) that is
facilitated by astrocytic aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channels.


[CHUNK 9359]
Moreover, removal of these AQP4 channels led to reduced
clearance of Aβ by 65%, suggesting the importance of these
channels in removing unwanted waste from the brain (Iliff
et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9360]
During sleep, there is an increase in the interstitial
space, which leads to an augmentation in the exchange between
CSF and ISF, facilitating Aβ clearance. 

[CHUNK 9361]
In fact, just one night
of acute sleep deprivation increases the levels of Aβ in the
brain, independently of ApoE genotype, indicating the direct
effect of sleep in AD pathology (Shokri-Kojori et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 9362]
Additionally, sleep also led to a decrease in ISF tau levels, shown
by ∼90% increase during wakefulness and ∼100% increase
during sleep deprivation (Holth et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 9363]
Moreover, these
results were also seen in the CSF of patients who were sleep
deprived, leading to a 50% increase in CSF tau levels. 

[CHUNK 9364]
Changes
in sleep precede the onset of cognitive symptoms seen in AD
patients, and sleep-wake cycle disturbances are proposed as
one of the earliest symptoms seen in AD. 

[CHUNK 9365]
Thus, disruptions in
the sleep-wake cycle could be considered a risk factor for AD
and early management of sleep-wake cycle disturbances could
prevent or slow the subsequent pathology and later onset of
AD. 

[CHUNK 9366]
Several strategies can be considered to modulate the effect
of sleep disturbances in dementia risk, from sleep drugs to
physical exercise (McCleery et al., 2016; Law et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 9367]
Orexin
is a neuropeptide that regulates wakefulness and is implicated
in various sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy and cataplexy.


[CHUNK 9368]
Treatment to effectively block orexin receptors mitigated brain
ISF levels of Aβ that were elevated due to wakefulness or sleep
deprivation in AD mice (Kang et al., 2009; Roh et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 9369]
Diet
Compiling evidence suggests that a Mediterranean diet (MeDi)
or Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
diet (MIND) reduce the risk of developing MCI or AD (Morris
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 9370]
MeDi is highly popular on its preventive effects
on AD (Scarmeas et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 9371]
A MeDi consists of a low
intake of saturated fatty acids, such as meat and poultry; a
low-to-moderate consumption of dairy products, such as cheese
and yogurt; a moderate amount of alcohol, such as wine; and
a high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish and
unsaturated fatty acids. 

[CHUNK 9372]
Studies performed in Spain, France,
North America, and recently in Australia, demonstrated that the
higher the adherence to a MeDi lowered the risk to contracting
diseases associated as risk factors for AD (Tangney et al.,
2011; Gardener et al., 2012) and protects against cognitive
decline in elderly population, specifically episodic memory and
global cognition (Trichopoulou et al., 2015; Valls-Pedret et al.,
2015; Loughrey et al., 2017), indicating that MeDi may reduce
Alzheimer’s risk. 

[CHUNK 9373]
A 3-year brain imaging study evaluated the
effects of a low to a high adherence MeDi on AD biomarkers
in 30–60-year-old cognitive normal participants. 

[CHUNK 9374]
The study
concluded that a higher MeDi adherence provided an average
of 1.5–3.5 years of protection against AD as well as a lower
adherence highlighted important AD biomarkers (Berti et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 9375]
MeDi has been shown to reduce oxidative stress by
decreasing intracellular reactive oxidative species, apoptosis,
and cells containing telomere shortening. 

[CHUNK 9376]
Elderly patients
adhering highly to MeDi demonstrated longer telomere length
and high telomerase activity (Boccardi et al., 2013), and high
intake of vegetables is also directly associated with longer
telomere length (Gu et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 9377]
Several studies point out
that the polyphenols found in the characteristic olive oil in
the MeDi regimen are the main active components to prevent
AD (Omar et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9378]
Oleuropein aglycone, present in extra
virgin olive oil, induces autophagy, decreases the amount of
aggregated proteins, decreases inflammation, and improves
cognitive function seen in AD (Grossi et al., 2013; Cordero
et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9379]
Hydrocytyrosol, another olive oil product, has
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 

[CHUNK 9380]
In APP/PS1 mice,
hydrocytyrosol
administration
reduces
mitochondrial
oxidative
stress,

inflammation
and

Edwards et al.


[CHUNK 9383]
Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
On the contrary, a high-fat diet (HFD) raises the risk of
developing obesity, leading to increased chances to develop
diabetes and, therefore, promoting the development of cognitive
deficits, and perhaps AD. 

[CHUNK 9384]
A HFD consists of a regimen where
the majority of the calories ingested come from a fat source
rather than carbohydrates or protein. 

[CHUNK 9385]
AD transgenic mice
fed using HFD for 4 months presented significant memory
impairment compared with AD mice eating regular diet (Sah
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9386]
There were no differences in the levels of Aβ
or ptau suggesting that HFD induces cognitive impairments in
an amyloid-independent pathway. 

[CHUNK 9387]
In fact, HFD has shown to
accelerate age-associated cognitive decline by decreasing BDNF
levels, inducing oxidative stress, and generating a loss in synaptic
plasticity (Thériault et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 9388]
As already mentioned, insulin resistance, impaired glucose
metabolism, and T2D are well known risk factors for AD. 

[CHUNK 9389]
These
conditions can be developed following a diet of high sugars,
carbohydrates and glycemic loads. 

[CHUNK 9390]
High-glycemic diet includes:
high-sugar beverages and foods, white pasta and rice, French
fries and baked potatoes, cereals with added sugar, and sundried
fruit. 

[CHUNK 9391]
A high-glycemic regimen correlates with an increment
in Aβ accumulation before AD manifestation (Taylor et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 9392]
Consumption of fish oil and an omega-3 fatty acid-rich
diet decreases plasma arachidonic acid/docosahexaenoic acid
(AA/DHA) ratio levels.


[CHUNK 9393]
MCI and AD patients
carrying
ApoEε4 present increased AA/DHA ratio compared to carriers
who did not present any cognitive deficiencies (Abdullah et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 9394]
DHA demonstrates a pleiotropic effect by balancing
cell signal pathways, synaptic plasticity, and the enzymatic
processing of Aβ (Davinelli et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 9395]
Fish oil/omega-
3 fatty acid was correlated with a decline in AA/DHA levels
and even in AD-ApoEε4 patients (Abdullah et al., 2017),
indicating that omega-3 supplementation could be considered
as an intervention against the risk of acquired AD, especially
in ApoEε4 carriers. 

[CHUNK 9396]
Whole food diet (WFD) consists of freeze-
dried fish, fruits, and vegetables. 

[CHUNK 9397]
AD mice fed with the
WFD were highly impaired in spatial memory compared to
controls and produced an elevated neuroinflammatory response
(Parrott et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 9398]
A large body of literature suggests that a balanced diet, full of
fruits, vegetables, and lean meat and fish along with low sugar
and high good fat content may be beneficial against cognitive
impairment and, therefore, decrease the chances to develop AD.


[CHUNK 9399]
However, recent studies have found no significant association
between dietary patterns, including MeDi, and risk for dementia
(Haring et al., 2016; Akbaraly et al., 2019), indicating that
adherence to healthy dietary patterns may not be enough to
reduce the risk to develop age-related cognitive impairment
and dementia.


[CHUNK 9400]
Smoking
Worldwide, approximately 1 billion people use tobacco products
in the form of cigarettes, and annually, there are at least 6 million
global deaths caused by tobacco-smoking related diseases (World
Health Organization, 2013). 

[CHUNK 9401]
Today, smoking-related incidence
has expanded from including CVD and stroke to now including
neurocognitive abnormalities (Swan and Lessov-Schlaggar, 2007;
Durazzo et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 9402]
Smoking leads to cognitive impairment
and decline shown by faster declines in verbal memory and
slower visual search speeds (Richards et al., 2003). 

[CHUNK 9403]
Additionally,
cognitive decline in smokers is directly proportional to the
number of packs they smoke per day (Kalmijn et al., 2002).


[CHUNK 9404]
Indeed, it is known that smoking has negative effects on
cardiovascular diseases which, as mentioned, are risk factors
of AD, stressing out the deleterious importance of smoking in
promoting dementia.


[CHUNK 9405]
Historically, smoking has been considered a preventative
measure from developing AD as many have stated that
nicotine improves short-term cognitive performances and
inhibits amyloid formation (Brenner et al., 1993; Lee, 1994).


[CHUNK 9406]
Actually, nicotine has been proven to reduce APP secretion
(Lahiri et al., 2002), inhibit Aβ aggregation (Dickerson and
Janda, 2002), and reduce Aβ load in AD transgenic mice
independently from inflammation (Nordberg et al., 2002;
Hellström-Lindahl et al., 2004). 

[CHUNK 9407]
However, more recent studies
have questioned this evidence and indicate that smoking
increases the chance to develop dementia and cognitive
decline (Ott et al., 1998; Anstey et al., 2007; Reitz et al.,
2007). 

[CHUNK 9408]
Confirming this negative effect, nicotine exacerbates
tau phosphorylation in experimental animals (Oddo et al.,
2005). 

[CHUNK 9409]
In addition, exposure to cigarette smoke exacerbates
Alzheimer’s-like pathology by increasing amyloid deposition,
inducing tau hyperphosphorylation, and exacerbating the
inflammatory response in a smoke-consumption concentration
dependent manner (Moreno-Gonzalez et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 9410]
Still some
studies indicate that when epidemiological data is adjusted for
competing risk of death without dementia, smoking seems not
to be associated with dementia development (Abner et al.,
2018), and, surprisingly, ApoEε4 carrier smokers are at a lower
risk of developing dementia than smokers without this allele
(Reitz et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 9411]
The mechanism by which smoking may
lead to an increased risk in AD development is uncertain, and
further studies need to be conducted for potential mechanisms
responsible for a possible increased risk of AD development.


[CHUNK 9412]
Alcohol
Alcohol consumption is considered a major risk factor for many
health problems. 

[CHUNK 9413]
Heavy drinking is defined as: consuming more
than four drinks a day (or 14 drinks a week) for males and
consuming more than three drinks a day (or seven drinks a
week) for females (Rehm, 2011). 

[CHUNK 9414]
Knowing that alcohol negatively
affects cognitive and motor functions, there is no surprise
that heavy drinking has been associated with an increased risk
of AD, whereas mild to moderate alcohol intake has been
associated with a lower risk (Heymann et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9415]
The extent
to which alcohol affects AD pathology is still debated today
as some believe that alcohol is protective of AD development
(Luchsinger et al., 2004), while others believe the contrary
(Piazza-Gardner et al., 2013), the latter being the strongest
current of opinion. 

[CHUNK 9416]
Heavy alcohol consumption leads to a
decline in cognitive performance similar to that observed in
AD (Weissenborn and Duka, 2003). 

[CHUNK 9417]
Loss of cholinergic neurons
observed in AD patients has also been reported in individuals
exposed to ethanol consumption (Fernandez and Savage, 2017;
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

[CHUNK 9418]
Edwards et al.


[CHUNK 9419]
Modiﬁable Risk Factors for Alzheimer’s Disease
Vetreno and Crews, 2018) as well as hippocampal atrophy
(Topiwala et al., 2017), linking heavy alcohol consumption
with cognitive impairment that may eventually trigger AD
development. 

[CHUNK 9420]
In fact, a combination of both smoking and
drinking can have a more impactful effect of AD incidence
than just one of those habits (Zhou et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 9421]
Some recent
reports indicate that alcohol use is not associated with prodromal
AD or disease progression (Heffernan et al., 2016; Bos et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 9422]
In addition to the potential link to trigger dementia,
alcohol abstinence after AD diagnosis seems to ameliorate
the cognitive damage initially observed (Toda et al., 2013),
suggesting the alcohol consumption can, not just increase the
risk of AD, but also worsen the progression of the disease in
heavy intake conditions (Heymann et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 9423]
A potential
mechanism proposed for alcohol to induce AD is by decreasing
glymphathic function (Lundgaard et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9424]
The glymphatic
system plays an important part in removing brain waste,
including Aβ. 

[CHUNK 9425]
Since alcohol decreases glymphatic function, heavy
drinking could induce Aβ accumulation by reducing its clearance
triggering the cognitive abnormalities that are seen in alcohol use
and AD.


[CHUNK 9426]
On
the
other
hand,
alcoholic
beverages
such
as
wine—particularly red—contain polyphenols including morin,
quercetin, resveratrol, and tannins, that are able to inhibit
amyloid aggregation and can have other beneficial effects
including reduction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and
balance of protein homeostasis (Dhouafli et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 9427]
In fact,
moderate drinking (1–2 drinks/day) has been proposed to be
protective against AD by reducing amyloid burden, decreasing
mortality, and reducing the risk of dementia (Russo et al.,
2003; Deng et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006), being low doses of
wine the most recommended to reduce the risk of dementia
(Xu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9428]
In AD animal models, low doses of ethanol
decrease Aβ-mediated synaptic toxicity by direct interaction
with Aβ peptide (Muñoz et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 9429]
This may be an indication
that the amount (dinks/day), length of consumption, period
of consumption (early or late life), and type of alcoholic
beverages (fermented or distilled drinks) should be taken into
consideration to determine the effect of alcohol consumption to
protect or induce AD dementia.


[CHUNK 9430]
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Despite over a century since discovering AD, there is no cure
that can halt, slow down, or reverse the progression of this
neurodegenerative disease. 

[CHUNK 9431]
Regardless of the tremendous effort
that the scientific field has done to find effective treatments
for AD, promising candidates fail when tested in AD patients
(Cummings et al., 2007; Raschetti et al., 2007; Extance, 2010;
van Dyck, 2018). 

[CHUNK 9432]
Most of the recent clinical trials that attempt
treating AD focus on inhibiting the main known culprits of
AD. 

[CHUNK 9433]
The central targets are amyloid production and aggregation,
largely Aβ by immune therapy and pharmacological enzyme
inhibition (BACE inhibitors); the use of NSAIDs to reduce
inflammation; and even stem cell therapy to fight against
neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 9434]
However, all these attempts have failed
probably because the therapeutic intervention was done in an
already very advanced pathology or because the treatment is
directed to the wrong target (Mehta et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9435]
It could also
well be that the proposed approach is targeting only one of the
players of this multifactorial disease. 

[CHUNK 9436]
Therefore, an alternative
strategy to fight against AD could be the prevention of the
known modifiable risk factors and related mechanisms for the
disease. 

[CHUNK 9437]
This includes proper management of comorbidities
associated such as vascular diseases (hypertension, CVD, stroke,
ischemia), diabetes, epilepsy, brain injuries, and depression as
well as modification of lifestyle and avoidance of deleterious
habits. 

[CHUNK 9438]
Here, we have reviewed many of them including:
physical activity, sleep, diet, and use of tobacco and alcohol,
and how by different mechanisms, these factors are able to
reduce amyloid deposition and ameliorate cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 9439]
Recent studies have estimated that intervention of several
modifiable risk factors could prevent up to 35% of dementia
cases (Livingston et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9440]
Management of diet, exercise,
and vascular risk in at-risk elderly population can, in fact,
prevent cognitive functioning deterioration (Kivipelto et al.,
2013; Ngandu et al., 2015; Soininen et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 9441]
However,
some reports suggest that changes in these habits should be
done early in life since modifying later life lifestyle factors
may not decrease the conversion of MCI to AD dementia
(Reijs et al., 2017) although it may ameliorate the course
of the disease. 

[CHUNK 9442]
Most of the studies compiled in this review
evaluate the effect of risk factors when the AD-associated
pathological changes are already present, but very few analyze
the potential of those factors in preventing the onset of the
disease, rather than the further development. 

[CHUNK 9443]
Furthermore,
most of the risk factors analyzed here can be considered
both the cause and effect of AD. 

[CHUNK 9444]
If they are a cause or
risk factor, preclinical intervention may prevent the onset
and development of AD, but if these factors are in fact an
effect or a symptom, their treatment will still slow down the
progression of the disease. 

[CHUNK 9445]
Hence intervention of potential
risks is highly recommended for either prevention or even
amelioration of clinical symptoms of AD since most of these
actions will also benefit general health status. 

[CHUNK 9446]
Therefore, and
while an effective treatment(s) is developed to treat AD,
the most reasonable approach is to prevent AD onset by
managing multiple risk factors way before any clinical symptom
is observed.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afﬂicts an estimated 20 million people worldwide and is the
fourth-leading cause of death in the developed world. 

[CHUNK 11002]
The most common cause of
dementia in older individuals, AD is characterized by neuropathologies including synaptic
and neuronal degeneration, amyloid plaques, and neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NTFs). 

[CHUNK 11003]
Amyloid
plaques are primarily composed of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ), which accumulates in the
brains of patients with AD. 

[CHUNK 11004]
Further, small aggregates termed Aβ oligomers are implicated
in the synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration underlying early cognitive impairments.


[CHUNK 11005]
Whether Aβ accumulates in part because of dysregulated clearance from the brain
remains unclear. 

[CHUNK 11006]
The ﬂow of substances (e.g., nutrients, drugs, toxins) in and out of
the brain is mediated by the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). 

[CHUNK 11007]
The BBB exhibits impairment
in AD patients and animal models. 

[CHUNK 11008]
The effect of BBB impairment on Aβ, and whether
BBB function is affected by non-neurological pathologies that impair peripheral clearance
requires further investigation. 

[CHUNK 11009]
In particular, impaired peripheral clearance is a feature of
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a spectrum of liver disorders characterized
by accumulation of fat in the liver accompanied by varying degrees of inﬂammation
and hepatocyte injury. 

[CHUNK 11010]
NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions, with an estimated
prevalence between 20% and 30% of the general population. 

[CHUNK 11011]
This chronic condition
may inﬂuence AD pathogenesis. 

[CHUNK 11012]
This review article summarizes the current state of
the literature linking NAFLD and AD, highlighting the role of the major Aβ efﬂux and
clearance protein, the LRP-1 receptor, which is abundantly expressed in liver, brain,
and vasculature.

[CHUNK 11017]
Both
are
reported
to
underlie
progressive
synaptic
dysfunction in the AD brain, loss of dendritic spines, and
neuronal death (Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011; Busche et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 11018]
Although AD was first described 100 years ago, its precise
etiology remains unknown. 

[CHUNK 11019]
Efforts to better understand AD
have resulted in multiple hypotheses to explain events in AD
pathogenesis, for example, the amyloid cascade theory that
describes the imbalance between Aβ production and clearance
(Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). 

[CHUNK 11020]
Here, we provide an overview of the
etiology of AD, and the principal concepts that support the
critical role of the brain-blood barrier (BBB) and liver in AD
development and progression.


[CHUNK 11021]
In neurons under physiological conditions, Aβ is secreted to
maintain normal synaptic function, morphology, and plasticity
(Wang et al., 2012; Gouras et al., 2015; Klevanski et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11022]
Aβ
is a by-product generated from cleavage of the amyloid protein
precursor (APP). 

[CHUNK 11023]
APP plays an important physiological role in
regulating γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR) and
modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity (Chen et al.,
2017; Doshina et al., 2017; Rice et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 11024]
In primary cortical
neurons, APP modulates frequency and amplitude of calcium
oscillations essential for synaptic transmission (Octave et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 11025]
A mouse model deficient for APP demonstrated that
APP is necessary for the synapsis and maintenance of dendritic
integrity in the hippocampus (Tyan et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 11026]
Likewise,
hippocampal neurons in culture derived from APP knockout
mice showed APP is critical for synaptogenesis and dendritic
and axonal growth process and regulates substrate adhesion
(Southam et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 11027]
On the other hand, in the amyloidogenic (i.e., disease-
causing) pathway, APP is cleaved by β- and γ-secretase to
generate Aβ, which accumulates as senile plaques (Hardy
and Selkoe, 2002; Konietzko, 2011). 

[CHUNK 11028]
AD-related plaques are
associated with high levels of soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ
(AβOs; Esparza et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 11029]
AβOs comprise soluble dimers
and trimers of low molecular weight and soluble oligomeric
forms of 12–14 monomers (Mroczko et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 11030]
In addition,
these oligomers have been identified as the toxic conformers
of Aβ plaques in AD (Jin et al., 2011; Verma et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 11031]
AβOs can diffuse across synaptic membranes (Hong et al.,
2014) and trigger a cascade of injurious events in neurons,
causing synaptic failure and memory loss (Morris et al., 2014;
Brito-Moreira et al., 2017).

Moreover, AβOs are associated with
dystrophic neurites, reactive astrocytes, and aberrant activation
of glutamatergic neurotransmission; the consequence of these
changes is neuronal death by excessive neuronal influx of
sodium and calcium (Ziegler-Waldkirch and Meyer-Luehmann,
2018). 

[CHUNK 11033]
Postsynaptic protein disruption (Lésne et al., 2013) and
hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment by AβOs contributes
to memory loss (Müller-Schiffmann et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 11034]
Intracellular
AβOs are detectable in cholinergic neurons, suggesting that
they play a critical role in cholinergic deficiency (Baker-
Nigh et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11035]
These devastating events not only lead to
memory loss and learning impairment in AD patients, but also
affect the capacities of reasoning, abstraction, and language
(Duyckaerts et al., 2009).

BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER BREAKDOWN
AND ROLE OF LRP-1 IN
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized structure that
supports brain function. 

[CHUNK 11037]
This structure supports the brain
by regulating electrolyte flux, cerebral blood flow (CBF) and
efficient oxygen and metabolite delivery, and restricting entry
of potentially toxic and even some therapeutic agents into the
brain (Provias and Jeynes, 2014; Andreone et al., 2015; Di
Marco et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11038]
BBB function is mediated by neurovascular
units (NVU) comprising neurons, glial cells, pericytes, and brain
endothelial cells, which maintain homeostasis of the cerebral
microenvironment (Armulik et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 11039]
Brain endothelial
cells are an important component mediating the flow between
brain and blood by cell-to-cell communications called tight
junctions and adherent junctions; these junctions connect cell
networks (Deli et al., 2005; Van de Haar et al., 2015) and
regulate the paracellular permeability of substances across the
BBB (Bowman and Quinn, 2008; Viggars et al., 2011; Kook et al.,
2013; Chow and Gu, 2015; Ulrich et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11040]
Tight junctions
proteins ZO-1, Occludin and CLN-5 are key to maintaining
BBB integrity (Jiao et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 11041]
ZO-1 joins tight junctions
with the actin cytoskeleton, working as accessory proteins (Xiao
et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 11042]
Occludin and CLN-5 are transmembrane tight
junction proteins involved in signal transduction of cytokines
(Haseloff et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11043]
The high expression of these proteins
on brain endothelial cells regulates the transport of essential
molecules through the BBB, such as the free and rapid diffusion
of oxygen and carbon dioxide (Lin et al., 2015; Pardridge,
2015). 

[CHUNK 11044]
Hydrophobic molecules permeate the BBB faster and
more easily than hydrophilic molecules, while molecules that
are larger than 180 KDa or water-soluble do not penetrate
the BBB (Kroll and Neuwelt, 1998; Zlokovic, 2005; Masserini,
2013). 

[CHUNK 11045]
For example, the BBB restricts the passage of albumin
and immunoglobulins, high-molecular-weight proteins from the
peripheral blood circulation (Xiao and Gan, 2013).


[CHUNK 11046]
Another important component of brain endothelial cells is
a complex and specific transport-receptor protein system that
also contributes to BBB permeability (Zlokovic, 2011). 

[CHUNK 11047]
The
luminal side of the BBB contains transporters for specific classes
of nutrients, such as glucose and vitamins, and receptors for
peptides, proteins, and hormones. 

[CHUNK 11048]
These mediators facilitate
transport across the BBB from circulating blood into the
brain (Deane and Zlokovic, 2007; Simpson et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 11049]
In
contrast, the transport system of the abluminal side of the BBB
eliminates neurotoxic molecules and metabolic waste (Begley and
Brightman, 2003).


[CHUNK 11050]
Dysfunction of the BBB, therefore, could result in altered
permeability. 

[CHUNK 11051]
Indeed, age-dependent BBB breakdown at the
hippocampus is associated with mild cognitive impairment and
correlates with pericytes injury. 

[CHUNK 11052]
This finding suggests that the
cerebrovascular integrity loss that begins at the hippocampus

Liver Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Progression
FIGURE 1 | Chronic liver diseases may increase amyloid burden and Alzheimer’s pathology. 

[CHUNK 11055]
This contribution results from an imbalance in peripheral amyloid-β (Aβ)
clearance as a result of decreased LRP1 levels, general liver dysfunction, and chronic inﬂammation. 

[CHUNK 11056]
These features may worsen blood-brain-barrier (BBB)
impairment and contribute to a vicious cycle. 

[CHUNK 11057]
As an example, the ﬁgure depicts fatty liver disease as a chronic liver condition.


[CHUNK 11058]
may contribute to early stages of dementia associated with AD
(Montagne et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11059]
Similarly, early cognitive dysfunction
has been associated with capillary damage and BBB breakdown
in older adults (Nation et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 11060]
This breakdown of BBB function may be related to alterations
in specific components of the BBB structure. 

[CHUNK 11061]
Low-density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) is a membrane
receptor that mediates the cellular internalization of multiple
ligands. 

[CHUNK 11062]
Further, LRP-1 regulates several tight junction proteins
in endothelial cells of the BBB (Zhao et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 11063]
Functional
LRP-1 is expressed in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LECs),
highly specialized scavenger cells, and LRP-1 expression
contributes to the rapid removal of its blood ligands (Øie
et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 11064]
Cell surface LRP-1 and circulating sLRP-1 are
needed for brain and systemic clearance of Aβ; however, in AD,
both cell surface LRP-1 and circulating sLRP-1 concentrations
are dramatically reduced (Sagare et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 11065]
Importantly,
these alterations may begin as early as two decades before the
manifestation of cognitive impairment symptoms (Beason-Held
et al., 2013; Jack et al., 2013; De Strooper, 2014). 

[CHUNK 11066]
Clearance of Aβ
may also be affected by other pathologies, however.


[CHUNK 11067]
CLEARANCE OF Aβ AT THE PERIPHERY:
ROLE OF THE LIVER
Peripheral organs, including the kidney and the liver, play an
essential role in the clearance of circulating Aβ. 

[CHUNK 11068]
Elimination of
Aβ from the circulation may contribute to AD progression, by
helping to displace the dynamic equilibrium from Aβ deposited
in the senile plaques toward soluble Aβ. 

[CHUNK 11069]
This hypothesis is
supported by evidence that peritoneal dialysis reduces the
circulating levels of Aβ in humans and diminishes AD features
in an animal model (Jin et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 11070]
Insufficient clearance of
brain Aβ also contributes to the progression of sporadic AD
(Wang et al., 2006). 

[CHUNK 11071]
As brain Aβ equilibrates with Aβ in plasma,
peripheral clearance of Aβ provides a potential approach to
facilitate efflux of Aβ from the brain (Liu et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11072]
Peripheral
organs and tissues are key in clearing brain-derived Aβ under
physiological conditions (Xiang et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 11073]
The liver has many functions, one of which is metabolic
detoxification. 

[CHUNK 11074]
When the liver is under constant injury, as is
found in metabolic diseases, it exhibits decreased detoxification
capacity. 

[CHUNK 11075]
Indeed, the expression of metabolic enzymes decreases
in conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cirrhosis (Rolle et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 11076]
Hepatocytes can act directly on circulating Aβ, promoting
its clearance by degradation or through bile excretion. 

[CHUNK 11077]
Further,
Aβ uptake from circulation can be mediated through LRP-1,
which is highly expressed in hepatocytes (Kanekiyo and Bu,
2014). 

[CHUNK 11078]
Interestingly, liver dysfunction is accompanied by low
LRP-1 hepatic expression and high levels of circulating Aβ.


[CHUNK 11079]
This correlation suggests that Aβ clearance decreases due to low
hepatic LRP-1 activity (Wang et al., 2017; see Figure 1).


[CHUNK 11080]
AD pathophysiology has not been evaluated from a hepatic
point of view; yet, the evidence points to a critical role for
liver in AD pathogenesis. 

[CHUNK 11081]
Aβ levels found in liver samples
from AD patients are lower when compared to neurologically
healthy controls, raising the possibility that the liver is not
properly eliminating circulating Aβ (Roher et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 11082]
This
observation is supported by studies where insulin promotes
LRP-1 translocation to the cell membrane in hepatocytes,
favoring Aβ clearance (Tamaki et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 11083]
The stimulation
of LRP-1-mediated liver uptake improves cognitive impairment
and decreases Aβ aggregation in the brain in AD transgenic mice
(Sehgal et al., 2012).

Liver Dysfunction in Alzheimer’s Progression
NAFLD/NASH AFFECTS Aβ CLEARANCE
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a
spectrum of liver disorders characterized by excessive fat
deposition in hepatocytes from individuals who drink little or no
alcohol. 

[CHUNK 11087]
NAFLD is an umbrella term for several subtypes ranging
from isolated hepatic steatosis, or fatty liver, to nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH). 

[CHUNK 11088]
NASH is defined by the presence of fatty
changes with inflammation and several degrees of hepatocellular
injury or fibrosis. 

[CHUNK 11089]
Thus, NASH is the aggressive form of NAFLD
and can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis.


[CHUNK 11090]
NAFLD/NASH is the leading cause of chronic liver disease
worldwide and has reached epidemic proportions. 

[CHUNK 11091]
Interestingly,
most of the deaths in NAFLD patients are not restricted to
liver-related morbidity or mortality; rather, cardiovascular
disease (CVD) and cancer predominate (Armstrong et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 11092]
Therefore, the presence of fatty liver is not a benign
pathology as was historically considered by most clinicians.


[CHUNK 11093]
Indeed,
extensive
evidence
in
recent
years
shows
that
NAFLD also increases the risk of end-stage liver disease,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver-related mortality, and
all-cause mortality. 

[CHUNK 11094]
These observations prompted the idea
that NAFLD/NASH, either independently or concomitantly
with other metabolic risk factors, determines or even drives
extra-hepatic diseases such as CVD, chronic kidney disease,
colorectal cancer, endocrine disorders like type 2 diabetes
mellitus, osteoporosis, and, indeed, AD. 

[CHUNK 11095]
Recent studies have
linked insulin-resistance (the key pathophysiological feature
of NAFLD) to several of the neurodegenerative mechanisms
of AD including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction,
and inflammation, via dysregulated insulin/IGF-1 signaling
with attendant impairments in signal transduction and gene
expression (de la Monte and Tong, 2014; de la Monte, 2017;
Kim et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 11096]
A network clustering analysis conducted by Karbalaei et al.


[CHUNK 11097]
(2018) indicated that there are 189 genes shared between
NAFLD and AD. 

[CHUNK 11098]
Further, three main groups of pathways
are candidates for contributing to both AD and NAFLD:
carbohydrate metabolism, long fatty acid metabolism, and IL-17
signaling pathways (Karbalaei et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 11099]
This suggests that
diabetes and obesity might be considered as a risk factor for AD
and NAFLD.


[CHUNK 11100]
One study showed that NAFLD promotes AD in mice
(Kim et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 11101]
This study evaluated whether NAFLD
induction, through a dietary approach (high-fat diet), promotes
the development of AD signs. 

[CHUNK 11102]
Brains of HFD-fed mice showed
increased levels of neuro-inflammation, characterized by higher
levels of cytokines, toll-like receptors, and microgliosis. 

[CHUNK 11103]
These
features were accompanied by increased plaque formation in a
transgenic mouse model of AD. 

[CHUNK 11104]
In addition, intense and frequent
signs of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)—a condition
characterized by the Aβ deposition in the media and adventitia
of small and mid-sized arteries—were observed in mice fed
with HFD.


[CHUNK 11105]
An abnormal lipid metabolism is linked with increased risk
for AD development, and the liver plays a crucial role since
is the main peripheral organ responsible for lipid metabolism
(Fukumoto et al., 2002; Hooijmans and Kiliaan, 2008). 

[CHUNK 11106]
Aβ is
able to bind Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and can be cleared from
the brain together with cholesterol (Mahley, 1988). 

[CHUNK 11107]
Interestingly,
ApoE is a ligand of LRP-1 and both are genetically associated
with AD and plasma Aβ levels (Kang et al., 2000). 

[CHUNK 11108]
This
link is intriguing since LRP-1 is suggested to facilitate Aβ
clearance from the brain across the BBB (Deane et al., 2004;
Sagare et al., 2012; see Figure 1).


[CHUNK 11109]
LIVER INFLAMMATION AND Aβ LEVELS
Hepatitis B is a liver infection that can become chronic
and severe. 

[CHUNK 11110]
Interestingly, Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) carriers
have significantly higher plasma Aβ levels than non-carriers.


[CHUNK 11111]
Moreover, HBV carrier status is associated with plasma Aβ
levels (Jin et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 11112]
Overall infectious burden including
cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-
1),
Borrelia
burgdorferi,
Chlamydophila
pneumoniae
and
Helicobacter
pylori
was
found
to
significantly
contribute
to AD pathogenesis (Bu et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11113]
However, currently,
no epidemiological study has been designed to understand
the association between HBV infection and the risk for
AD. 

[CHUNK 11114]
The effect of chronic inflammation on Aβ clearance is
lesser than the effects of HBV infection or liver dysfunction
(Liu et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 11115]
Further, although plasma concentrations
of cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 are significantly increased in
cirrhosis patients and plasma IL-6 levels are correlated with
Aβ40 levels (a 40 amino acid proteolytic product of APP
cleavage that has gained attention as a biomarker correlating
with AD), no association is observed by linear regression
between IL-6 and Aβ40 levels. 

[CHUNK 11116]
On the other hand, the
ratio of AST/ALT, which is an indicator of liver functional
impairment (Giannini et al., 1999), is significantly associated
with circulating Aβ40 levels (Wang et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 11117]
Furthermore,
hepatic dysfunction may lead to a plethora of systemic changes.


[CHUNK 11118]
Approximately 95% of Aβ in the blood is bound to serum
albumin (Stanyon and Viles, 2012). 

[CHUNK 11119]
The serum albumin pool
represents an important reservoir for peripheral clearance of
Aβ. 

[CHUNK 11120]
Thus, a diminution in blood albumin in cirrhotic patients
might contribute to the increase in plasma Aβ levels (see
Figure 1).


[CHUNK 11121]
CONCLUDING REMARKS
AD
is
a
degenerative
condition
that
will
afflict
an
increasing number of people as the global population ages.


[CHUNK 11122]
Unfortunately, current treatments have only transient or
modest effects. 

[CHUNK 11123]
This article reviews evidence that supports
the involvement of liver diseases, a growing health concern,
in AD pathogenesis. 

[CHUNK 11124]
The liver is the major player in the
clearance of Aβ at the periphery, and an impairment of
this clearance may shift the delicate Aβ equilibrium toward
brain accumulation.


[CHUNK 11125]
As to the possible role that the liver plays in brain-derived Aβ
clearance, the impaired clearance of serum Aβ might contribute
to the high Aβ levels in NAFLD patients. 

[CHUNK 11126]
This effect is likely due
to an intensification of the BBB disruption and drop in LRP-1

It is possible that hepatic malfunction contributes to AD

failure to maintain Aβ homeostasis at the periphery; (ii) acting
as a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines when chronic
inflammation follows different types of injury (like virus
infection, drug-induced injury, and metabolic diseases); and

Objective: To study the efﬁcacy of grip strength (GS) as a predictor of cognitive function
in a large, nationwide sample of Chinese participants aged 45 years and above.


[CHUNK 11624]
Methods: We used data from three waves (W1, W2, and W3) ﬁelded by the China
Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). 

[CHUNK 11625]
Cognitive function was tested
biennially and calculated using two categories: episodic memory and mental intactness.


[CHUNK 11626]
Demographics, health behaviors, and medical conditions were considered potential
confounders. 

[CHUNK 11627]
Using multivariate linear regression models (MLRMs), we examined the
association between baseline GS (measure in W1) and cognitive function in W3. 

[CHUNK 11628]
Using
a generalized estimating equation (GEE), we examined baseline GS as a predictor of
cognitive function change.


[CHUNK 11629]
Results: Total 9,333 individuals (53.2% women), with a mean baseline episodic memory
score of 6.5, mean baseline mental intactness score of 7.2, and aged over 45 years
(mean age = 58.6), were selected. 

[CHUNK 11630]
The mean follow-up time was 4.0 years (range: 3.3–
5.0 years). 

[CHUNK 11631]
Using MLRMs and comparing the lowest GS score with the highest baseline
GS score, we observed a signiﬁcant correlation with a higher global cognitive function
in both women (β = 1.061, p < 0.001) and men (β = 1.233, p < 0.001). 

[CHUNK 11632]
After adjusting
baseline global cognition, the highest GS level was still statistically signiﬁcant in both
women (β = 0.543, p < 0.05) and men (β = 0.742, p < 0.001). 

[CHUNK 11633]
GEE suggested that
the participants in the highest GS quartile had better cognitive performance over time in
both women (β = 0.116, p = 0.030) and men (β = 0.143, p = 0.008) than those in the
lowest quartile.


[CHUNK 11634]
Conclusion: Higher baseline level of GS was signiﬁcantly related to better cognitive
function and slowed the rate of its decline. 

[CHUNK 11635]
Thus, it is an independent predictor of better
cognitive status in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.

Grip Strength and Cognitive Function
INTRODUCTION
Cognitive disorders (CDs), also known as neurocognitive
disorders (NCDs), are a category of mental health disorders
that primarily aﬀect cognitive abilities such as learning, memory,
perception, and problem solving. 

[CHUNK 11639]
NCDs include delirium and
mild to major NCD (previously known as dementia) (Simpson,
2014), which contribute to the disability and decreased life-
span, considerably aﬀecting quality of life in the elderly (Murray
et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 11640]
Currently there are no cures for these diseases,
thus, identifying predictive clinical signs of cognitive decline
and dementia is imperative for the implementation of an
adapted care. 

[CHUNK 11641]
However, the complex association between physical
performance and cognitive function might provide an insight
into the possible therapeutic and prophylactic measures in these
diseases (Amieva et al., 2005). 

[CHUNK 11642]
Previously, grip strength (GS) has
been represented as a predictive factor for Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) (Rijk et al., 2015), considering that cognitive impairments,
AD and other common neurodegenerative diseases, are preceded
by a “silent” clinical period that can last longer than a
decade. 

[CHUNK 11643]
Identifying such “soft” physical signs associated with
the progressive decline of cognitive function has important
implications in the early intervention for these illnesses.


[CHUNK 11644]
Several studies aimed to assess the associations between GS
and cognitive decline or dementia; some (Camargo et al., 2016;
Praetorius Björk et al., 2016; Veronese et al., 2016; Hooghiemstra
et al., 2017), but not all (Atkinson et al., 2010), reported a positive
relationship. 

[CHUNK 11645]
It is evident that poor GS is associated with a greater
risk of dementia. 

[CHUNK 11646]
Furthermore, a small number of studies have
suggested that higher GS at baseline is a protective factor in
preventing the development of AD (Rijk et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 11647]
However,
their cross-sectional and longitudinal association have not been
fully investigated, and thus, remain unclear in China. 

[CHUNK 11648]
Therefore,
we aimed to examine the predictive accuracy of baseline GS levels
for cognitive function as well as its slow decline over time in a
large, population-based sample derived from the “China Health
and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).”
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Sample
The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study is a
nationwide longitudinal survey conducted by the National School
of Development at Peking University in China on people above
45 years of age. 

[CHUNK 11649]
The data of CHARLS is publicly accessible.


[CHUNK 11650]
Researchers could apply for the data by signing a data usage
agreement online and providing his/her basic information.


[CHUNK 11651]
Details of the survey protocol and implementation involved
in the CHARLS have previously been described (Zhao et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 11652]
The survey included three waves covering 150 county-
level units distributed in 28 provinces of China. 

[CHUNK 11653]
The baseline
(W1) survey was conducted in 2011–2012 on 17,708 participants
with a high response rate. 

[CHUNK 11654]
But only 78.9% of them did physical
performance measures (Zhao et al., 2014), reducing the sample to
13,965 individuals. 

[CHUNK 11655]
Compared to the baseline sample (n = 17,705),
this subsample were, on average, signiﬁcantly older (p = 0.006),
with a higher proportion of females (p = 0.043), people with
married status (p < 0.001) and people less educated (p < 0.001)
(Supplementary Table S1). 

[CHUNK 11656]
Of the 13,965 individuals, 13,204
individuals with baseline GS was included (269 individuals
were excluded because they were less than 45 years old,
203 individuals were excluded for memory-related diseases at
baseline, 284 individuals were excluded for stroke history at
baseline and 5 outliers were identiﬁed for GS at W1). 

[CHUNK 11657]
The
third wave (W3) survey successfully re-interviewed 10,641 of
these individuals in 2015–2016, and 2,563 (19.4%) were lost to
follow-up. 

[CHUNK 11658]
All surveys, including the questionnaire, laboratory
measurements, and physical function were administered by well-
trained clinicians in a face-to-face setting. 

[CHUNK 11659]
Here, 9,333 individuals
who underwent the three wave surveys were included (407
individuals had missing value for GS at W1, 901 individuals did
not complete the cognitive test at W1, W2, or W3). 

[CHUNK 11660]
There were no
signiﬁcant demographic characteristics (gender and educational
attainment), heath status (other than hearing problems), health
behavior diﬀerences between the baseline participants 13,965 and
the third wave 9,333. 

[CHUNK 11661]
Compared to the baseline sample, 9,333
individuals were signiﬁcantly younger (p < 0.001), with higher
proportion of married status (p < 0.001), a lower proportion
of hearing problems (p < 0.001) and better average cognitive
(p < 0.001) and GS (p < 0.001) scores (Table 1). 

[CHUNK 11662]
Study diagram
and exclusion criteria were listed in the Figure 1.


[CHUNK 11663]
Cognitive Function
Cognitive performance, in CHARLS, was calculated using
two categories: episodic memory and mental intactness. 

[CHUNK 11664]
Each
respondent was asked to immediately repeat as many Chinese
nouns as possible, from a list read to him/her (immediate
word recall) and to recall the same 5 min later (delayed recall)
(Wang et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 11665]
Episodic memory was deﬁned as the
summation of immediate and delayed recall scores ranging from
0 to 20. 

[CHUNK 11666]
Mental intactness scores, which included numerical
ability, time orientation, and picture drawing, were obtained
from the following set of questions: serial sevens, temporal
orientation (date, month, year, day of week, and season), and
intersecting pentagon copying test. 

[CHUNK 11667]
Answers to these questions
were accumulated into a score named mental intactness ranging
from 0 to 11. 

[CHUNK 11668]
The global cognitive function was the summation
of the episodic memory and mental intactness scores. 

[CHUNK 11669]
Baseline
cognition scores were calculated at W1.


[CHUNK 11670]
Grip Strength
Grip
strength
(kilogram)
was
estimated
through
the
dynamometer
(WCS-100,
Nantong,
China).


[CHUNK 11671]
Individuals
needed to squeeze the handles as long and as tightly as possible
or until the needle stopped rising. 

[CHUNK 11672]
Individuals also needed to
be in a standing position with their arms hanging naturally at
their sides. 

[CHUNK 11673]
Additional measurements were recorded for each
hand, while alternating the sides, giving a total of two readings
for each side. 

[CHUNK 11674]
The best of the four GS measurements was used
in statistical analyses. 

[CHUNK 11675]
We conducted the analysis separately
for men and women to identify gender diﬀerences in muscle
strength (Metter et al., 1997; Gallagher and Heymsﬁeld, 1998;
Baumgartner et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 11676]
GS scores were divided into quartiles,

[CHUNK 11687]
Educational attainment was categorized as

[CHUNK 11688]
Smoking and

Others were dichotomized as either “no” or “yes.”
Statistical Analysis
First, descriptive statistics were used to show the characteristics
of the study sample. 

[CHUNK 11690]
The t-test/Mann–Whitney U test and chi-
square test were used for comparison of baseline characteristics
between two samples. 

[CHUNK 11691]
The linear correlations between baseline
GS and cognitive function in W3 were estimated using
multivariate linear regression models (MLRMs) with potential
confounders. 

[CHUNK 11692]
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used
to examine the predictive capability of baseline GS for changes
in cognitive function over a period of 4 years. 

[CHUNK 11693]
MLRMs was
used to analyze the cross-sectional association using two models.


[CHUNK 11694]
We adjusted for age, education, marital status, health status,
health behaviors, and BMI in model 1. 

[CHUNK 11695]
Model 2 was further
adjusted as model 1 with baseline cognition. 

[CHUNK 11696]
GEE was used to
analyze longitudinal association using three models. 

[CHUNK 11697]
In model
1, the analysis was adjusted for baseline global cognition, age,
follow-up time, education, marital status, BMI. 

[CHUNK 11698]
Model 2 was
adjusted as model 1 with further adjustment for GS.

[CHUNK 11702]
We chose GEE because it extends the
generalized linear model to allow further analysis of longitudinal
data. 

[CHUNK 11703]
Secondly, because parameter estimation in GEE models
remained relatively stable, it allowed us greater ﬂexibility in
modeling the eﬀects of time on our results (Zeger and Liang,
1986; Zeger et al., 1988). 

[CHUNK 11704]
All data were analyzed using STATA
version 13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, United States). 

[CHUNK 11705]
The
level of signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS
Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the sample.


[CHUNK 11707]
A total of 9,333 individuals (4,365 men and 4,968 women)
were included in the current study after excluding those who
did not complete the necessary measurements at W1 or W3
and who were under 45 years of age at W1 (Figure 1).


[CHUNK 11708]
The mean participant age was 58.6 years [standard deviation
(SD) = 8.7 years], 53.2% of the participants were women, and
84.7% were married. 

[CHUNK 11709]
With regards to educational attainment,
30.8% attended primary school or above. 

[CHUNK 11710]
Near-vision impairment
(23.3%), hypertension (22.7%), far-vision impairment (26.1%),
fall-related injuries (15.8%), hearing problems (12.5%), and heart
problems (11.0%) were the most common medical conditions.


[CHUNK 11711]
The mean of follow-up time was 4.0 years (SD = 0.1 years),
ranging from 3.3 to 5.0 years. 

[CHUNK 11712]
Baseline GS ranged from 6 to
73 kg/m2 for men (mean = 39.7 kg/m2, SD = 8.9 kg/m2), and from
2 to 100 kg/m2 for women (mean = 27.1 kg/m2, SD = 7.3 kg/m2).


[CHUNK 11713]
The mean baseline global cognition score, episodic memory and
mental intactness were 13.7 (SD = 5.7), 6.5 (SD = 3.7), and 7.2
(SD = 3.1), respectively.


[CHUNK 11714]
Table 2 shows the relationship between the baseline GS level
and baseline cognitive function through MLRMs. 

[CHUNK 11715]
The higher GS
signiﬁcantly associated with better cognition in wave 1. 

[CHUNK 11716]
After
adjusting for potential confounders in female, referenced to the
lowest GS level, the third quartile was the most highly associated
with global cognition (β = 1.442, p < 0.001). 

[CHUNK 11717]
Alternatively, for
men, the highest GS level was the most highly related to global
cognitive function (β = 1.388, p < 0.001).

The second quartile of GS level and
the global cognitive function did not demonstrate statistically
signiﬁcant association.

Alternatively, for men, the highest GS level was related to
highest global cognitive function (β = 1.233, p < 0.001).


[CHUNK 11738]
In model 2, the second and third quartiles level of GS did
not show statistical signiﬁcance. 

[CHUNK 11739]
However, positive correlations
between the highest GS level and better cognitive measures were
observed (β = 0.742, p < 0.001).

signiﬁcantly lower rate of decline in global cognition over time
compared to those in the lowest quartile. 

[CHUNK 11762]
The participants in the
fourth quartile, compared to those in the ﬁrst quartile, had a
parameter estimate of 0.125 points per year (SE = 0.052; p < 0.05).


[CHUNK 11763]
In model 3, after adjusting for all covariates, the correlation
between GS-by-time interaction (fourth quartile) and cognitive
function over 4 years remained statistically signiﬁcant (β = 0.116
with SE = 0.053, p = 0.030). 

[CHUNK 11764]
Similar results (β = 0.143 with
SE = 0.054, p = 0.008) were also observed for participants in
fourth quartile compared to those in ﬁrst quartile with regards to
men. 

[CHUNK 11765]
Other factors, such as older age and hearing problems, were
associated with a decline in global cognition score in women.


[CHUNK 11766]
However, factors such as far-vision impairment besides older
age were associated with poor performance in global cognition
for men. 

[CHUNK 11767]
Higher educational attainment and marital status were
associated with better cognitive function in both the sexes.

[CHUNK 11769]
DISCUSSION
We examined the longitudinal relationship between GS and
cognitive performance in 9,333 middle-aged and elderly Chinese
participants. 

[CHUNK 11770]
The analysis identiﬁed that higher baseline GS level
was associated with better cognitive function with ageing and
lower rates of decline in cognitive performance over a period of
4 years in both men and women. 

[CHUNK 11771]
Even after adjusting for the
relevant, potentially confounding independent variables, the two
parameters showed signiﬁcant association.


[CHUNK 11772]
Our ﬁndings are similar to those of previous studies,
which demonstrated that GS could predict cognition over time
(Stijntjes et al., 2016; Jeong and Kim, 2018; Wang et al.,
2019), for instance, Veronese et al. 

[CHUNK 11773]
(2016) found that lower
handgrip strength could predict incident cognitive decline in
a population of 1,249 elderly community dwellers over a
period of 4.4 years. 

[CHUNK 11774]
However, there were studies that reported
results contrary to our ﬁndings, for example, a 6-year follow-
up study by Atkinson et al. 

[CHUNK 11775]
(2010) revealed that there was
no signiﬁcant association between physical performance (such
as gait, balance, and GS) and cognitive changes in 1,793
elderly women. 

[CHUNK 11776]
There are several reasons for the diﬀerences
in the reported results, one of which could be that our study
included a signiﬁcantly larger sample size and demonstrated a
better study design.


[CHUNK 11777]
Mechanistically, our ﬁndings are in accordance with the most
notable hypotheses known as the “common cause hypothesis,”
which demonstrates that cognition and muscle strength may
share the same brain regions and networks (Christensen et al.,
2001). 

[CHUNK 11778]
Several researchers have drawn similar conclusions by
observing the association between gait and cognitive function
(Demnitz et al., 2016; Kueper et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 11779]
Furthermore,
they also introduced Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome
based on these associations, which can be used to identify
people at risk of dementia in the population (Ayers and
Verghese, 2016). 

[CHUNK 11780]
This form of bounded rationality provides
a reasonably straightforward way to implement the concept
that simple motor tests or physical functions could be studied
as biomarkers for identifying patients at a higher risk of
cognitive impairment and dementia. 

[CHUNK 11781]
However, there is still
no direct imaging evidence to prove the rationality of this

theory. 

[CHUNK 11787]
Although it could be speculated from some studies
(Rosano and Snitz, 2018) that brain areas between motor
coordination and cognitive function have an overlap, we would
need a signiﬁcantly intuitive research design to prove and
reﬁne this theory.


[CHUNK 11788]
Recognition of early risk factors for CDs has paramount
practical signiﬁcance, particularly if the predictors were in the
form of easily developed indicators. 

[CHUNK 11789]
Training programs that
improve balance and GS might also help to either prevent or
slow cognitive decline in the elderly, particularly in those with
reduced muscle strength. 

[CHUNK 11790]
Lower grip strength, poor balance, and
gait might be crucial identiﬁcation markers for patients who
require exercise programs. 

[CHUNK 11791]
A number of randomized controlled
trials reveal that exercise programs in elderly adults can improve
both their physical and cognitive functions (Kim, 2011; Yoon
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 11792]
However, other studies show contradicting results
(Emery and Gatz, 1990). 

[CHUNK 11793]
This is an important area that requires
further exploration.


[CHUNK 11794]
One of the advantages of this prospective study was
that it has a large number of subjects, hence drawing
signiﬁcantly reasonable conclusions. 

[CHUNK 11795]
Last but not least, this
study used a longitudinal design to conﬁrm that GS predicts
changes in cognition over a relatively long follow-up time
in Chinese population. 

[CHUNK 11796]
However, this study had several
limitations. 

[CHUNK 11797]
Firstly, the cognitive domains studied were relatively
limited and we could not evaluate the speciﬁc cognitive
domains. 

[CHUNK 11798]
Secondly, 19.4% of the original participants were
lost to follow-up and 12.3% of the re-interviewed subjects
at W3 were not included in the study due to incomplete
baseline GS test or incomplete cognitive test at W1, W2
or W3. 

[CHUNK 11799]
Otherwise, their inclusion may have inﬂuenced the
association between GS and cognitive function as determined
in this study. 

[CHUNK 11800]
Thirdly, other confounding factors, such as
healthy diet and physical activity, may inﬂuence the results
that could not be accounted for this time. 

[CHUNK 11801]
The future
study will include additional related factors, such as gait
speed, balance and other physical measurements to verify the
present conclusion.


[CHUNK 11802]

elderly
adults
predicted

cognition

years,

decline.

Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and Z-drugs are compounds widely prescribed in medical
practice due to their anxiolytic, hypnotic, and muscle relaxant properties. 

[CHUNK 12004]
Yet,
their chronic use is associated with cases of abuse, dependence, and relapse
in many patients. 

[CHUNK 12005]
Furthermore, elderly people are susceptible to alterations in
pharmacodynamics,
pharmacokinetics
as
well
as
to
drug
interaction
due
to
polypharmacy. 

[CHUNK 12006]
These situations increase the risk for the appearance of cognitive
affectations and the development of pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 

[CHUNK 12007]
In the
present work, there is a summary of some clinical studies that have evaluated the effect
of BZDs and Z-drugs in the adult population with and without AD, focusing on the
relationship between their use and the loss of cognitive function. 

[CHUNK 12008]
Additionally, there is an
assessment of preclinical studies focused on ﬁnding molecular proof on the pathways
by which these drugs could be involved in AD pathogenesis. 

[CHUNK 12009]
Moreover, available data
(1990–2019) on BZD and Z-drug use among elderly patients, with and without AD, was
compiled in this work. 

[CHUNK 12010]
Finally, the relationship between the use of BZD and Z-drugs for
the treatment of insomnia and the appearance of AD biomarkers was analyzed. 

[CHUNK 12011]
Results
pointed to a vicious circle that would worsen the condition of patients over time. 

[CHUNK 12012]
Likewise,
it put into relevance the need for close monitoring of those patients using BZDs that
also suffer from AD. 

[CHUNK 12013]
Consequently, future studies should focus on optimizing strategies
for insomnia treatment in the elderly by using other substances like melatonin agonists,
which is described to have a much more signiﬁcant safety proﬁle.

Benzodiazepines as a Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease
INTRODUCTION
Sleep disturbances have been reported to increase Amyloid
Beta (Aβ) levels in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid of healthy subjects,
contributing to the advancement of neurodegeneration and the
appearance of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Lopez et al.,
1999; Virta et al., 2007; Modabbernia et al., 2011; Consensus
and Statements, 2014; Di Meco et al., 2014; Benedict et al.,
2015; Gage et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Gaugler et al., 2016;
Kincheski et al., 2017; La Frenais et al., 2017; Livingston et al.,
2017; Atkin et al., 2018; Burke et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12017]
At preclinical
level, it has been described that sleep deprivation in 3xTg
mice acts as a chronic stressor, favoring the decrease of Cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding
(CREB) and aﬀecting synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions
(Di Meco et al., 2014) (Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 12018]
It has been described that
sleep restriction increases susceptibility to Amyloid beta (Aβ)-
induced memory impairment in mice (Kincheski et al., 2017),
accompanied by increased plasma levels of corticosterone, just
like higher levels of brain pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [tumor
necrosis factor alfa (TNFα), interleukin 1 beta (IL1-β) and IL-6],
which contributed to memory impairment and synapse damage.


[CHUNK 12019]
Consequently, sleep alterations have become major risk factors
for the development of sporadic pathologies like AD and need
to be properly managed by drugs that will restore balanced
physiological sleep periods (Kincheski et al., 2017; Hennawy
et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12020]
Benzodiazepines
(BZDs)
and
their
analogous
Z-drugs
are psychotropic drugs commonly used in medical practice
FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of potential pathways by which insomnia and benzodiazepines could increase AD risk. 

[CHUNK 12021]
Insomnia is a CNS stressor, which
induces microglial activation and oxidative stress. 

[CHUNK 12022]
Likewise, oxidative stress may be involved in cognitive impairment by decreasing phosphorylation levels of p-CREB
and altering dendritic spines and synapses. 

[CHUNK 12023]
Moreover, sleep disturbances prevent clearing toxic metabolites such as β-amyloid. 

[CHUNK 12024]
These lead to an increased
production of inﬂammatory cytokines and the formation of Aβ-plaques. 

[CHUNK 12025]
In turn, BZDs activate GABAA receptors, thus interfering excitatory synapses and decreasing
cognitive reserve. 

[CHUNK 12026]
Moreover, these drugs have been shown to decrease BDNF as well as increase β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA levels and tau
phosphorylation. 

[CHUNK 12027]
All these mechanisms could increase the risk of cognitive impairment through neuroinﬂammation, decrease synaptic plasticity and brain insulin
signaling as well as accumulation of Aβ plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.


[CHUNK 12028]
against anxiety, nervousness, convulsive states, depression,
and psychosis. 

[CHUNK 12029]
They also act as skeletal muscle relaxants and
hypnotics for the treatment of short-term acute insomnia
(Dolder et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 12030]
On a molecular level, BZDs and Z-drugs
facilitate the inhibitory activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) on its receptor (Duke et al., 2018),
favoring the ﬂow of chlorine ions through the ionotropic channel
bound to the receptor and producing the hyperpolarization
of neuronal membranes (Sigel and Ernst, 2003). 

[CHUNK 12031]
The GABAA
receptor is an ionotropic receptor composed of ﬁve protein
subunits that mediate diﬀerent behavioral and pharmacological
responses (Mehdi, 2012; Duke et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12032]
The α1 subunit of the
GABAA receptor is thought to be responsible for sedative eﬀects,
while the α2 and α3 subunits exert anxiolytic and antidepressant
activities. 

[CHUNK 12033]
Finally, the α5 subunit is involved in the control of
cognitive functions such as memory and learning (Rissman et al.,
2007; Savi´c et al., 2010).


[CHUNK 12034]
From a pharmacokinetic point of view, BZDs and related
drugs are divided into three groups according to their half-life.


[CHUNK 12035]
It can either be long (over 24 h), intermediate (between 6 and
24 h), or short (<6 h). 

[CHUNK 12036]
Usually, short and intermediate-acting
BZDs are prescribed for insomnia, while longer-acting BZDs
are reserved for anxiety, but their eﬀects can vary with age and
liver metabolic capacity. 

[CHUNK 12037]
Old age is associated with a decrease of
oxidative metabolism, causing an extension on drug half-life due
to changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Taipale
et al., 2015; Hessmann et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12038]
In fact, the prolonged use
of these drugs (over 2 months) in advanced age has shown to
produce serious side eﬀects, causing tolerance and dependence,

[CHUNK 12040]
Likewise, oxidative stress may be involved in cognitive impairment by decreasing phosphorylation levels of p-CREB\nand altering dendritic spines and synapses. 

[CHUNK 12041]
Moreover, sleep disturbances prevent clearing toxic metabolites such as β-amyloid. 

[CHUNK 12042]
These lead to an increased\nproduction of\ninﬂammatory cytokines and the formation of Aβ-plaques. 

[CHUNK 12043]
In turn, BZDs activate GABAA receptors, thus interfering excitatory synapses and decreasing\ncognitive reserve. 

[CHUNK 12044]
Moreover, these drugs have been shown to decrease BDNF as well as increase β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) mRNA levels and tau\nphosphorylation. 

[CHUNK 12045]
All these mechanisms could increase the risk of cognitive impairment through neuroinﬂammation, decrease synaptic plasticity and brain insulin\nsignaling as well as accumulation of Aβ plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles.

Ettcheto et al.


[CHUNK 12048]
Benzodiazepines as a Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease
increased risk of falls and fractures as well as an impairment of
cognitive processes (Pharmd et al., 2003; Obradovi et al., 2005;
Stewart, 2005; Rissman et al., 2007; Savi´c et al., 2010; Rosenberg
et al., 2012; Makaron et al., 2013; Biétry et al., 2017; Nørgaard
et al., 2017; Duke et al., 2018; Picton and Pharm, 2018; Underlien
et al., 2018; Scott and Aricescu, 2019).


[CHUNK 12049]
The eﬀects of BZDs and other hypnotic drugs on cognition
in elderly patients are intensive areas of research nowadays
(Carlisle, 2017). 

[CHUNK 12050]
In a recent study, Kurlawala et al. 

[CHUNK 12051]
reported a
case of a 76-year-old male who presented onset of short-term
memory loss after a 3 year treatment with a BZD (Kurlawala
et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12052]
Magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that
cognitive loss could be a result of atrophy in the hippocampus
and cortex (Barker et al., 2004; Hessmann et al., 2018; Kurlawala
et al., 2018; Picton and Pharm, 2018). 

[CHUNK 12053]
Studies performed by
the groups of Glass et al. 

[CHUNK 12054]
and Kripke et al. 

[CHUNK 12055]
reported that the
adverse eﬀects of hypnotics outweigh the beneﬁt they achieve
in the population older than 60 years, going so far as to
increase mortality risk in some patients (Glass et al., 2005; Kripke
et al., 2012; Hammond and Esclapez, 2015). 

[CHUNK 12056]
Consequently, these
results have led the National Institutes of Health and the Beers
Criteria of the American Geriatric Society to list molecules,
such as eszopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon, as “potentially
inappropriate medications” (Consensus and Statements, 2014;
Investigations, 2015; Taipale et al., 2015; Wennberg et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12057]
It was determined that BZDs should be avoided or should only
be prescribed for short and speciﬁc situations (Letter, 2019;
Walsh and Roth). 

[CHUNK 12058]
However, BZDs and Z-drugs are still widely
inappropriately prescribed in sleepless patients (Gunja, 2013;
Pariente et al., 2016; Nørgaard et al., 2017; Richardson et al.,
2018).


[CHUNK 12059]
Luckily, alternatives to BDZs exist to treat situations of
sleep deprivation. 

[CHUNK 12060]
Sateia et al. 

[CHUNK 12061]
published a clinical practice
guideline for the treatment of insomnia in the Journal of Clinical
Sleep Medicine (Sateia et al., 2017a,b). 

[CHUNK 12062]
In their manuscript,
the authors suggest ramelteon for sleep-onset insomnia. 

[CHUNK 12063]
This
drug selectively binds to the melatonin receptors, avoiding
dependence and other important side eﬀects associated with
BZD long-term treatment. 

[CHUNK 12064]
In the same paper, the authors also
recommend Z-drugs or BZD hypnotics for sleep maintenance in
insomnia (Sateia et al., 2017a). 

[CHUNK 12065]
In 2018, the U.S. 

[CHUNK 12066]
Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved several non-BZD compounds
for the treatment of insomnia (Richardson et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12067]
These
include antidepressants with anxiolytic or sedative action, such
as escitalopram, doxepin, trimipramine, and amitriptyline as
well as heterocyclic drugs like trazodone and mirtazapine
(Gunja, 2013; Richardson et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12068]
The objective of this article was to review and discuss
published material on the risk of BZD and Z-drug use and their
role in the appearance of cognitive loss in cases of AD.


[CHUNK 12069]
THE POTENTIAL MOLECULAR
MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN
BENZODIAZEPINES AND RELATED DRUG
INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT
Although the molecular mechanisms by which BZDs and
psychotropic drugs could induce cognitive impairment are
uncertain, several hypotheses have been suggested (Gage et al.,
2015). 

[CHUNK 12070]
These mechanisms are summarized in Figure 1.


[CHUNK 12071]
One hypothesis states that elderly long-term consumers of
BZDs show limited cognitive reserve capacity. 

[CHUNK 12072]
This concept
refers to the ability to tolerate age-related and disease-related
changes in the brain due to the existence of strong and
redundant synaptic connections in the brain. 

[CHUNK 12073]
This mechanism
would allow resisting longer neurodegenerative pathologies
without
developing
clear
cognitive
clinical
symptoms
or
memory loss (Stern, 2012). 

[CHUNK 12074]
Since BZDs and Z-drugs are positive
GABAA receptor modulators, they decrease brain activation
and reduce synaptic plasticity, aﬀecting the patient’s ability to
create a new memory. 

[CHUNK 12075]
Thus, BZDs interfere with the function
of excitatory synapses, which is required for memory. 

[CHUNK 12076]
In
addition, the loss of social networks in aging people could act
as an additional factor that may also aﬀect cognitive function.


[CHUNK 12077]
Likewise, BZD treatment for sleep disturbances in aging
could limit the capacity to create social communication
networks
and
precipitate
the
development
of
dementia
(Wan et al., 2004; Pariente et al., 2016; Mohamad et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12078]
The composition of GABAA receptors could also be involved
in cognitive alterations related to hypnotic drugs. 

[CHUNK 12079]
It has been
reported that the binding of BZDs to the α5GABAA subunit,
which is almost exclusively found in the hippocampus and deep
layers of the cortex, impairs memory for contextual information
in monkeys (Wan et al., 2004; Mohamad et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 12080]
Of
note, Zolpidem did not impair the performance of a task based
on visual cues which could be explained by its aﬃnity for
the α1GABAA, instead of α5GABAA (Mohamad et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12081]
Moreover, it has been reported that the memory-impairing
eﬀects of BZDs are not blocked by the α1GABAA-selective BZD
antagonist β-carboline-3-carboxylate-3-butyl-ester, whereas the
α5GABAA antagonist XLi-093 blocked the eﬀects of triazolam
but not zolpidem (Caraiscos et al., 2004; Mohamad et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12082]
These ﬁndings suggest a speciﬁc role of α5GABAA receptor in
BZD-related cognitive impairment. 

[CHUNK 12083]
Furthermore, recent reports
suggest that the modulation of extrasynaptic tonic inhibition of
α5GABAA in the CA1 hippocampus and cerebral cortex could
improve and regulate memory processes in the hippocampus.


[CHUNK 12084]
Therefore, negative modulation of α5GABAA could be a suitable
target for the development of potential therapies against cognitive
dysfunction in neurological diseases (Caraiscos et al., 2004).


[CHUNK 12085]
Contrarily, Joksimovi´c et al. 

[CHUNK 12086]
demonstrated that α1GABAA
subunit receptor activation may aﬀect the spatial learning
performance in rodents (Joksimovi´c et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 12087]
They also
reported that α1GABAA subunit is involved in anterograde
amnesia, sedation, motor incapacitation, and anticonvulsant
BZD eﬀects.


[CHUNK 12088]
On another front, the “GABAergic deaﬀerentation hypothesis
of brain aging” introduced by Marczynski is based on the fact that
administration of diazepam to rats causes a diminution of glucose
utilization in the brain (Marczynski, 1995, 1998). 

[CHUNK 12089]
Since a decrease
in cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels is a feature of
the aging process and AD, it would be logical to consider a
potential metabolic inﬂuence of BZDs–GABA receptor complex
in the brain, predisposing to AD in aging (Marczynski, 1995).


[CHUNK 12090]
Regarding this, the administration of ﬂumazemil, an antagonist
of BZDs, increases glucose utilization in rodents (Marczynski,
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

January 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 344

[CHUNK 12091]
Ettcheto et al.


[CHUNK 12092]
Benzodiazepines as a Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease
1998). 

[CHUNK 12093]
Thus, a potential mechanism explaining the deleterious
eﬀects of BZDs on cognitive processes could be the depolarization
and the depressive action of BZD agonists leading to brain
energy metabolism deﬁcit. 

[CHUNK 12094]
In addition, BZD agonists may
inhibit the eﬀects of paracrine-autocrine neurotrophin family.


[CHUNK 12095]
Indeed, it is well-known that nerve growth factor (NGF)-related
proteins participate in the regulation of survival, growth, and
maintenance of neurons. 

[CHUNK 12096]
In this sense, Zhao et al. 

[CHUNK 12097]
reported
that mice under long-term diazepam administration showed
behavior alterations and reduced hippocampal synaptophysin
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (Zhao
et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 12098]
This is a matter of importance since BDNF
inﬂuences the functional aspects of synaptic transmission by
(i) enhancing the number of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in the postsynaptic
membrane, (ii) enhancing Long term potentiation (LTP), and
(iii) reducing GABAA receptor expression and decreasing
inhibitory GABA-ergic neuro-transmission in the hippocampus
(Jovanovic, 2004). 

[CHUNK 12099]
Through this mechanism, BZDs could inhibit
the axonal transport in both directions, increase the formation of
neuroﬁbrillary tangles, and also induce the βAPP-mRNA gene
expression, thus increasing the risk of AD. 

[CHUNK 12100]
Furthermore, the
glutamate levels could also be aﬀected by destabilizing neuronal
Ca2+ homeostasis, and neurons could be more sensitized to the
eﬀects of glutamate (Jovanovic, 2004).


[CHUNK 12101]
Recently,
an
interesting
study
of
Whittington
and
collaborators
reported
that
midazolam
increased
tau
phosphorylation in C57BL/6 mice (Whittington et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12102]
Consequently, the authors suggested that the eﬀects of the
most frequently used BZDs on tau phosphorylation should be
evaluated in deep since they could be strongly involved in the
increase of AD risk. 

[CHUNK 12103]
Indeed, pathogenic forms of tau, including
soluble tau oligomers, can promote neuronal dysfunction and
cognitive loss by several mechanisms at the early stages of
disease (Forner et al., 2017; Tracy and Gan, 2018). 

[CHUNK 12104]
Likewise,
Marciniak and collaborators reported that tau protein could be
involved in the regulation of brain insulin signaling, which plays
a fundamental role in the cognitive process (Marciniak et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 12105]
They demonstrated that the alteration of insulin signaling
in preclinical models of AD could occur through alterations
of tau.


[CHUNK 12106]
It is also well-known that apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele
is a risk factor of AD (Stonnington et al., 2009). 

[CHUNK 12107]
The presence
of this allele is associated with an increased Aβ accumulation
as well as with an increase in cognitive decline and disease
development when compared to other APOE allelic variants.


[CHUNK 12108]
In this respect, Pomara and collaborators reported an increased
sensitivity to the cognitive adverse eﬀects of acute doses of
lorazepam in elderly carriers of the APOE4 allele (Pomara
et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 12109]
Thus, it seems that APOE4 could also be a risk
for psychotropic drug-mediated cognitive decline. 

[CHUNK 12110]
Likewise, the
same group suggested that subjects who carry the very long
Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40 Homolog
(TOMM40) Poly-T Length and do not possess the ǫ4 allele
might also be at increased risk for BZD-related cognitive loss.


[CHUNK 12111]
Therefore, the inﬂuence of APO E genotype on hypnotics as risk
factors for AD seems relevant, and APOE4 genotyping could be
useful in guiding physicians about avoiding BZD prescription in
at risk patients. 

[CHUNK 12112]
Finally, Stonnington and collaborators reported
that acute 2 mg dose of lorazepam given to middle aged (50–65
years) cognitive normal adults caused higher decline in verbal
episodic memory and visuospatial memory/executive function in
ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers (Stonnington et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 12113]
However, Aβ might also have indirect eﬀects on the
inhibitory GABAergic transmission as a result of the dynamic
GABAergic balance modulation of the other two excitatory
systems (cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission).


[CHUNK 12114]
Interestingly, it has recently been suggested that the imbalance
between excitatory and inhibitory systems underlies the synaptic
dysfunction caused by Aβ (Rissman et al., 2007).


[CHUNK 12115]
CLINICAL STUDIES
Between November 2018 and February 2019, we performed a
literature review on clinical studies linked to the research topic
in three acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and
PubMed. 

[CHUNK 12116]
The collocated keywords were as follows: Alzheimer’s
disease AND benzodiazepines, Benzodiazepines AND cognitive
impairment, Benzodiazepines AND cognitive decline, hypnotics
AND cognitive decline, Z-drugs AND cognitive impairment,
hypnotics AND Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 12117]
The keywords were
combined and integrated in the database and journal searches.


[CHUNK 12118]
The terms used were searched using AND to combine the
keywords listed and using OR to remove search duplication
where possible. 

[CHUNK 12119]
References of retrieved articles that the authors’
searches may have missed or could have been ignored were
also assessed.


[CHUNK 12120]
All these studies were fully investigated and considered under

Case–Control Studies
Data from studies reviewed in this section can be found
in Table 1.


[CHUNK 12124]
In a nested case–control study, Lagnaoui et al. 

[CHUNK 12125]
concluded
that there was a small increased risk of dementia after the
administration of GABAA activators (Lagnaoui et al., 2002).


[CHUNK 12126]
Notwithstanding, the authors acknowledged that the eﬀect of
exposure to other non-evaluated drugs with possible Central
Nervous System (CNS) eﬀects, such as antipsychotics, could
have biased the results. 

[CHUNK 12127]
In another study, the same group
evaluated the prevalence of BZD use in AD patients for 3
months, raising awareness about the use of BZDs in elderly AD
patients (Lagnaoui et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 12128]
The same authors conducted
a case–control study with data from a large representative
cohort of Canadian older women in order to examine the
association between BZDs and AD. 

[CHUNK 12129]
They found a non-signiﬁcant
tendency toward an association between former use of BZDs
and increased risk of cognitive decline.

[CHUNK 12197]
Several confounding
factors were considered, such as chronic diseases
(COPD, asthma, cerebrovascular dementia,
diabetes), abuse of other substances,
socioeconomic status and the use of
antidepressants or antipsychotics 5 years before the
diagnosis of AD.


[CHUNK 12198]
BZD and related drug use was
associated with a modestly
increased risk of AD. 

[CHUNK 12199]
No major
differences were observed
among different subcategories
of BZDs (BZDs, Z drugs,
short-/medium-acting or
long-acting BZDs)
of cases (n = 73) and controls (n = 437) prevented reaching
statistical signiﬁcance.


[CHUNK 12200]
Wu et al. 

[CHUNK 12201]
conducted two case–control studies in Taiwan using
the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) with
data of people aged ≥45 from 1997 to 2004 (Wu et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 12202]
The main conclusions of the study were that long-term use of
BZDs or similar drugs might be associated with increased risk for
dementia and cognitive alterations in prevalent and chronic users
over a maximum follow-up of 8 years. 

[CHUNK 12203]
The authors also suggested
that risk of dementia was associated with higher cumulative
dosage and longer duration of BZD exposure (Wu et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 12204]
In the second study, the same group stated that this association
was reversible since BZD discontinuation could decrease the risk
of dementia (Wu et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 12205]
In 2012, Billioti de Gage et al. 

[CHUNK 12206]
performed a study in a
French population. 

[CHUNK 12207]
The main conclusion was that the new use
of BZDs was associated with an about 50% increase in the risk
of AD (Billioti de Gage et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 12208]
In 2014, the same group
assessed the eﬀects of exposure to BZDs among 10 up to 5
years before the diagnosis of AD, considering both the doses
and the reason for prescription (anxiety, depression, insomnia)
in a population of aged individuals of Quebec (Canada) (Billioti
de Gage et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 12209]
They concluded that the chronic use of
BZDs was associated with a higher risk of AD when daily doses
ranged between 91 and 180 mg/kg (cumulative dose expressed
as prescribed daily, during 3–6 months), and increased further
with doses higher than 180 mg/kg (during more than 6 months
of exposure).


[CHUNK 12210]
Gomm et al. 

[CHUNK 12211]
reported that the risk of dementia increased by
21% in patients receiving regular hypnotic drug prescriptions
when compared to non-users (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.13–1.29; p < 0.001) (Gomm et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 12212]
The authors also reported the existence of a period
of about 3 years from the ﬁrst prescription of the BZDs to
the diagnosis of dementia. 

[CHUNK 12213]
This study did not create speciﬁc
selection methods for those individuals with higher potential
risk of AD, such as those with APOE4 allele or low educational
level. 

[CHUNK 12214]
Likewise, the study only focused on the analysis of regular
hypnotic users.


[CHUNK 12215]
Saarelainen et al. 

[CHUNK 12216]
conducted a study in a Finnish cohort
of 70,718 subjects diagnosed with AD between 2005 and 2011
in order to investigate the eﬀects of BZDs and Z-drugs in a
population of AD patients compared with matched controls
(Saarelainen et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 12217]
The authors concluded that these
psychotropic drugs could inhibit the beneﬁcial eﬀects of the
drugs used in the treatment of AD, either anticholinesterases
or memantine. 

[CHUNK 12218]
Furthermore, AD patients treated with BZDs
showed a risk of mortality up to 41% higher than those who did
not use such drugs. 

[CHUNK 12219]
Z-drugs did not increase the risk of death,
but authors suggested that they could not be considered safer in
persons with dementia (Saarelainen et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12220]
Another study was performed in a wide population of Finland
for 6 years (Tapiainen et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12221]
Currently, this is the
largest study assessing the eﬀect of BZDs and Z-drugs on AD
risk. 

[CHUNK 12222]
Moreover, the authors concluded that BZDs and Z-drugs
modestly increased AD risk since the OﬀRatios (OR) after
adjusting for another concomitant psychotropic medication was

[CHUNK 12247]
They did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between BZD subcategories (long or short action).


[CHUNK 12248]
Controversially, there are some studies questioning the notion
that BZDs/Z-drugs increase the risk of cognitive loss. 

[CHUNK 12249]
For
instance, in a study performed by Infeld et al., the results
showed that long term use of BZDs did not increase the risk
of AD (Imfeld et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 12250]
Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were
calculated with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) of developing
AD or VaD in relation to previous BZD use, stratiﬁed by
duration and benzodiazepine type. 

[CHUNK 12251]
The OR of developing AD
for those who started BZDs 1 year before AD diagnosis was
2.20 (1.91–2.53) and fell to the null for those who started
between 2 and 3 years before [aOR 0.99 (0.84–1.17)] (Imfeld
et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 12252]
In the same line, Biétry et al. 

[CHUNK 12253]
evaluated the
risk of AD after a period of 2 years of BZD and related
drug treatment before AD diagnosis (Biétry et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 12254]
The
results of the study indicated that the risk of developing AD
was not associated with BZDs or Z-drugs. 

[CHUNK 12255]
Likewise, the half-
life of BZDs was not linked with AD risk (Biétry et al.,
2017).

[CHUNK 12259]
Benzodiazepines as a Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease
Several prospective and retrospective cohort studies which
have assessed the association of BZDs/Z-drugs and related drugs
on cognitive function reported controversial results.


[CHUNK 12260]
For example, the study of Lopez et al. 

[CHUNK 12261]
concluded that the use
of BZDs in AD patients should be done with great caution and
its use would not be adequate due to the risks of falls (Lopez
et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 12262]
Also, in the treatment of insomnia, they suggested
the use of other medications such as antihistaminic drugs. 

[CHUNK 12263]
Also,
Ellul et al. 

[CHUNK 12264]
suggested that the prescription of antipsychotics and
BZDs can accelerate cognitive decline in patients with AD (Ellul
et al., 2007). 

[CHUNK 12265]
In the prospective long-term “Caerphilly study,”
results also evidenced the association between the use of BZDs
and the increased risk of developing both vascular and non-
vascular dementia (Gallacher et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 12266]
The authors studied
a representative sample of men with a follow-up rate over
22 years. 

[CHUNK 12267]
They reported a signiﬁcant higher risk for dementia
with the use of BZDs. 

[CHUNK 12268]
Moreover, Rosenberg et al. 

[CHUNK 12269]
suggested
that antipsychotics and BZDs showed an increase in cognitive
loss associated with a high Persistency Index (Rosenberg et al.,
2012). 

[CHUNK 12270]
Lee et al. 

[CHUNK 12271]
evaluated the risk of AD after the use of
sedative-hypnotic antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs (Lee
et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12272]
Interestingly, the risk of AD was higher in patients
receiving a deﬁned daily dose over 30 deﬁned daily dose (DDD).


[CHUNK 12273]
Likewise, in this study, diﬀerent groups of BZDs were evaluated,
and intermediate BZDs were associated with the highest risk
of dementia. 

[CHUNK 12274]
This study concluded that the risk of AD was
associated with BZDs and sedative-hypnotic drugs, and that this
association was dose-dependent (Lee et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12275]
In another
study performed in Taiwan, Chen et al. 

[CHUNK 12276]
used data from the
NHIRD, which covered 23 million registered patients from 1995
to 2010, accounting for 99% of the population (Chen et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 12277]
The authors clearly indicated the hypnotic drugs used which
were classiﬁed into two groups: BZDs and Z-drugs. 

[CHUNK 12278]
The results
suggested that both hypnotics should be considered risk factors
for dementia in patients with long-term insomnia. 

[CHUNK 12279]
Likewise, an
association between higher prescribed dosages of BZDs and Z-
drugs and risks of dementia was found, which is in agreement
with previous studies (Tapiainen et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12280]
It has been proposed that older people with anxiety may have
a higher risk of AD development and involved an increase of
Aβ levels in adults with MCI and AD (Pietrzak et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 12281]
Thus, Burke et al. 

[CHUNK 12282]
investigated the role of anxiolytic drugs
in the risk of AD. 

[CHUNK 12283]
Likewise, they evaluated the association of
APOE ε4, currently the most important risk factor in LOAD
(Burke et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 12284]
One important ﬁnding of the study was
that ε4 carriers had a statistically higher signiﬁcant risk of AD
development; however, this eﬀect was moderated by the use of
anxiolytics. 

[CHUNK 12285]
Anxiolytics, alprazolam, lorazepam, paroxetine, or
venlafaxine, speciﬁcally, may improve the association of anxiety
on MCI and AD development. 

[CHUNK 12286]
However, in the same study
the authors reported that clonazepam conferred a statistically
signiﬁcant increased risk of MCI development among users of ε4
with anxiety, suggesting that there is a molecular mechanism on
cognition that is altered by clonazepam.


[CHUNK 12287]
Divergently, the prospective population-based cohort study
published by Gray et al. 

[CHUNK 12288]
investigated the risk of dementia
associated with cumulative dosage of BZDs after an average
follow-up of 7 years (Gray et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 12289]
They reported
a small increased risk of dementia in people with low
or moderate BZD treatment. 

[CHUNK 12290]
However, the study concluded
that BZDs do not increase the risk of AD (Gray et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 12291]
Furthermore, another team examined patients with
recently diagnosed mild AD which were treated with anti-
dementia medications such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
(donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and memantine. 

[CHUNK 12292]
The
authors reported an association between AD and an increased
use of psychotropic drugs (Törmälehto et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 12293]
However,
the administration of psychotropic medications was not related
to alterations in cognitive performance (Törmälehto et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 12294]
Finally, Grande and collaborators showed that patients treated
with short- and long-acting BZDs presented adjusted MMSE
mean scores of 25.4; 95% CI 25.1–25.7, while non-treated patients
had 25.9; 95% CI 25.3–26.4 (short acting BZDs); 25.3; 95% CI
25.2–25.5 (long-acting BZDs); (p = 0.156) (Grande et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12295]
Therefore, the authors stated that the use of BZDs was not
associated with an increase in cognitive loss in patients suﬀering
initial cognitive alterations.


[CHUNK 12296]
Longitudinal Studies
Data from studies reviewed in this section can be found
in Table 3.


[CHUNK 12297]
In a study performed in a young adult population, Boeuf-
Cazou et al. 

[CHUNK 12298]
concluded that, although long-term exposure to
BZDs leads to speciﬁc impairment in long-term memory only in
women, a longer period of observation is necessary to ascertain if
these alterations are associated with a risk of developing dementia
in old age (Boeuf-Cazou et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 12299]
Yet, in a large population-based cohort study named “The
Three-City Study,” Shash et al. 

[CHUNK 12300]
compared short- vs. 

[CHUNK 12301]
long-half-life
BZDs as well as the eﬀects of other psychotropic medications on
dementia on non-institutionalized individuals aged ≥65 starting
in 1999. 

[CHUNK 12302]
The authors concluded that users of long half-life
BZDs had a 60% increased risk of developing dementia (Shash
et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 12303]
Also, it was examined whether the chronic use
of BZDs over 4 years was associated with an increased risk of
cognitive decline (Paterniti et al., 2002). 

[CHUNK 12304]
The study demonstrated
that prolonged use of BZDs was a signiﬁcant risk factor for
the cognitive decline in the elderly which was evaluated by the
MMSE, the Trail Making Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution.


[CHUNK 12305]
Finally, it had been described that BZDs decrease cognitive
performance, although the eﬀects were small. 

[CHUNK 12306]
In addition, they
suggested that higher BZD treatment duration and cumulative
doses were responsible for the negative eﬀects on cognition in
elderly patients (Bierman et al., 2007).


[CHUNK 12307]

study to evaluate the eﬀects of chronic BZD use on cognitive
decline in people over 65 years old in France (Mura et al.,
2013). 

[CHUNK 12310]
A total of 5,195 persons were included in the study,
969 of which were chronic users of BZDZs.

However, the authors stated that BZDs
could deteriorate cognitive performance, increase the depletion

(Mura et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 12338]
Later, another team aimed to evaluate
the prevalence of BZD and Z-drug use in a population of
Finland (Taipale et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 12339]
The authors concluded that
approximately half of the people with AD used BZDs and Z-
drugs during the 4 years of follow-up, and that AD patients
used more BZDs in the long term that those without AD.


[CHUNK 12340]
In another study, the same group investigated the risk of
any stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) associated with BZDs
and Z-drugs in patients with AD taken from the MEDALZ-

[CHUNK 12341]
They found an increase of 20% in the risk
of ischemic stroke in AD patients using BZDs and Z-drugs.


[CHUNK 12342]
However, the risk of hemorrhagic stroke was not increased
(Tolppanen et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 12343]
Contrarily, Zhang et al.

Benzodiazepines as a Risk Factor in Alzheimer’s Disease
In turn, He et al. 

[CHUNK 12352]
pooled 10 studies to assess the association
between BZDs and risk of dementia. 

[CHUNK 12353]
PubMed and Embase
databases were systematically searched for relevant publications
up to September 2017. 

[CHUNK 12354]
The literature search focused on
observational studies that analyzed the relationship between the
long-term use of BDZs and the risk of dementia. 

[CHUNK 12355]
Their main
ﬁndings pointed to a signiﬁcantly increased risk of dementia in
the elderly population using BZDs. 

[CHUNK 12356]
This eﬀect was associated
with the use of BZDs with a longer half-life and with a longer
treatment duration (He et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 12357]
Finally, a meta-analysis of 12 prospective and retrospective
cohort studies and case–control studies about the risk of BZDs
and AD was reported. 

[CHUNK 12358]
The team concluded that the use of
BZDs—mainly those of long-action—and Z-drugs was associated
with the development of dementia. 

[CHUNK 12359]
However, the study showed
some limitations since it did not diﬀerentiate between BZDs
eﬀects on AD and vascular dementias, neither between long- and
short-acting BZDs (Lucchetta, 2018).


[CHUNK 12360]
DISCUSSION
In the present review, we discussed the evidence pointing to
BZDs as risks factors for cognitive decline in aging and AD
(Paterniti et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2016; Picton and Pharm,
2018).


[CHUNK 12361]
Sleep disorders increase with age, altering clearance of toxic
and waste products from the brain, including Aβ (Clinton
et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 12362]
It has been reported that sleep disturbances
could contribute to neurodegeneration and AD by altering
physiological metabolic functions, increasing oxidative stress,
and the accumulation of Aβ as well as due to the appearance
of neuroinﬂammatory responses (Phan and Malkani, 2019)
(Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 12363]
In addition, insomnia is also associated with
hypertension, diabetes, and a higher obesity risk; all of them
contributing to AD (Clarke et al., 2018; Frozza et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12364]
Bearing this in mind and considering the increase in insomnia
diagnostics, especially in the elderly, this situation has led to
higher consumption of hypnotic drugs in the adult population
to improve sleep quality. 

[CHUNK 12365]
Notwithstanding, and seeing the
possible consequences derived from their intake, there needs
to be a signiﬁcant increase in awareness about their risks.


[CHUNK 12366]
In fact, there have been some studies reporting that the
consumption of BZDs favors the appearance of cognitive
aﬀectations and increases the number of deaths in patients
with AD (Imfeld et al., 2015; Saarelainen et al., 2017; Grande
et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 12367]
Yet, as we have already assessed, there is
controversy, and other researchers defend that BDZs have
no such detrimental eﬀects (Picton and Pharm, 2018). 

[CHUNK 12368]
Thus,
even though BZDs improve various measures of insomnia
in the aged population, their clinical value is debatable,
and melatonin agonists could be a much safer choice when
trying to manage sleep disorders (Investigations, 2015). 

[CHUNK 12369]
For
the treatment of anxiety in the elderly, the administration
of other medications such as serotonin uptake inhibitors
(sertraline) or other compounds could be more adequate
(Consensus and Statements, 2014; Investigations, 2015).


[CHUNK 12370]
In the end, the mechanisms by which BZDs and Z-drugs could
increase the risk of cognitive loss and AD remain to be clariﬁed;
here we have discussed some speciﬁc hypotheses. 

[CHUNK 12371]
Thanks to
molecular biology, the α1 subunit of the GABA has been shown
to play an important role in BZD-mediated cognitive loss.


[CHUNK 12372]
Hence, it has been reported that higher activity at the α1GABAA
receptors induced by positive allosteric modulation at the BZD
site is responsible for spatial learning and memory incapacitation
in preclinical models. 

[CHUNK 12373]
Besides, activation of the α5 subunit, which
is mainly expressed in the hippocampus, could in part explain
the memory deﬁcit states induced by BZDs. 

[CHUNK 12374]
Therefore, α5GABA-
targeting compounds could improve cognition, thus having
therapeutic potential in AD and other dementias (Adrienn et al.,
2017). 

[CHUNK 12375]
It is conceivable that BZDs inﬂuence cognition and
probably increase the risk of AD acting through hippocampal
α5GABAA, while Z-drugs (α5GABAA-independent) confer a
lower risk. 

[CHUNK 12376]
In addition, the neuroinﬂammatory process is per
se a risk factor for AD. 

[CHUNK 12377]
The brain microglia play a prominent
role in neuroinﬂammation, and it is associated with the secretion
of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines. 

[CHUNK 12378]
Likewise, α5GABAA receptor
activity is enhanced by the inﬂammatory process, a fact that
is probably critical in inﬂammation-induced memory deﬁcits
(Marczynski, 1998). 

[CHUNK 12379]
Moreover, BZDs and other drugs may
increase cognitive loss and AD risk through the phosphorylation
of tau protein, which can also inhibit the signaling of the
brain insulin receptor (Jovanovic, 2004; Whittington et al.,
2019).


[CHUNK 12380]
In spite of these described eﬀects, it could be hypothesized
that BZDs may indirectly exert a protective eﬀect against
the development of AD by improving sleep (through their
clinical eﬀects on sleep latency, number of awakenings,
and duration and quality of sleep) (Guzmán et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12381]
This
paradigm
states
that
the
enhancement
of
GABAA
receptor
activity
by
BZDs
could
inhibit
glutamatergic
neurotransmission, thereby protecting against the excitotoxic
eﬀects of glutamate on the pathogenesis of AD (Fastbom et
al., 1998). 

[CHUNK 12382]
Moreover, it is noteworthy that some clinical trials
reported no association between BZDs and risk of cognitive loss
and AD.


[CHUNK 12383]
In conclusion, we do not have enough data to ensure a
causal relation between psychotropic drugs and cognitive
loss. 

[CHUNK 12384]
However, a therapeutic strategy based on BZDs and
Z-drugs in elderly people should be extensively evaluated
and monitored (Monzani et al., 2015; Yi et al., 2018).


[CHUNK 12385]
After reviewing the available data, a controversial question
remains: is it safe to prescribe BZDs and Z-drugs to improve
sleep in older patients, despite the potential cognitive loss
risk?


[CHUNK 12386]
We
strongly
believe
that
there
are
enough
data
supporting
an
extremely
cautious
attitude
with
Z-drugs
and the avoidance of BZD prescription in elderly people
with AD.

Abstract: Objective: The dramatic increase in the population with dementia expected in the next 
decades is accompanied by the establishment of novel and innovated methods that will offer accurate 
and efficient detection of the disease in its early stages. 

[CHUNK 12973]
While Alzheimer’s disease is the most common 
cause of dementia, by the time it is typically diagnosed, substantial neuronal loss and neuropathological 
lesions can damage many brain regions. 

[CHUNK 12974]
The aim of this study is to investigate the main risk factors that 
affect and increase Alzheimer’s disease progression over time even in cases with no significant memory 
impairment present. 

[CHUNK 12975]
Several potential markers are discussed such as oxidative stress, metal ions, 
vascular disorders, protein dysfunctions and alterations in the mitochondrial populations.  


[CHUNK 12976]
Conclusion: A multiparametric model of Alzheimer’s biomarkers is presented according to the latest 
classification of the disease. 


[CHUNK 12977]
Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers, oxidative stress, metal ions, vascular disorders, protein dysfunctions, 
mitochondrial dynamics, mild cognitive impairment.

INTRODUCTION 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is referred as one of the most 
common causes of dementia and frailty [1]. 

[CHUNK 12980]
Typically, the 
symptoms of the disease begin with mild memory difficulties 
and evolve towards cognitive impairement, dysfunctions in 
complex daily activities, and several other aspects of 
cognition [1]. 

[CHUNK 12981]
By the time that AD is clinically diagnosed, 
neuronal loss and neuropathologic lesions occur in many 
brain regions [2]. 

[CHUNK 12982]
Crucial role for the suspension of the 
potential damages 
is the timely drug delivery of 
neuroprotective medications before AD turns into mildly 
symptomatic [2].  


[CHUNK 12983]
To approach this goal, our capability to identify 
individuals with very mild symptoms prior to dementia 
needs to be improved [3]. 

[CHUNK 12984]
A few diagnostic criteria 
concerning imaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid 
biomarkers have been already published in order to establish 
a multivariate classification for AD [4]. 


[CHUNK 12985]
With the pessimistic projection of AD population and its 
corresponding social cost in the years between 2030 and 
2050, the scientific and clinical research in the area of AD is 
nowadays directed to the early diagnosis of the transitional 
phase between normal aging, mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and dementia [4]. 

[CHUNK 12986]
Lately, the concept of MCI has 
been expanded to address observed clinical heterogeneity. 


[CHUNK 12987]
Two subtypes are recognized, amnesic and nonamnesic, with

While amnesic syndromes are the most common 
symptoms of AD early onset, researchers are particularly 
focused on the analysis  of the medial temporal lobe memory 
system [5]. 

[CHUNK 12989]
When patients are diagnosed with AD dementia, 
memory impairments appear to be significantly correlated 
with medial temporal lobe atrophy and hypoactivation [5]. 


[CHUNK 12990]
Mitochondrial electrophysiology or electrodermal activity 
skin conductance analysis may be particularly useful for 
detecting alterations in brain function that may be present 
very early in the progression of AD, possibly a long time 
before the development of clinical symptoms and even 
significant neuropathology [6-7].  


[CHUNK 12991]
According to the latest National Institute on Aging and 
Alzheimer’s Association workgroup, an accurate diagnosis 
can be based on the general clinical and pathophysiological 
conditions and the assessment of several in vivo biomarkers 
and memory tests (Fig. 

[CHUNK 12992]

Albert et al. 

[CHUNK 12994]
proposed a 
classification of 8 categories for AD: Prodromal AD, AD 
dementia, Typical AD, Atypical AD, Mixed AD, Preclinical 
States of AD, Alzheimer’s Pathology and MCI [8]. 

[CHUNK 12995]
The term 
Prodromal AD or Predementia Stage of AD is used for early 
symptomatic, predementia stage of AD where clinical 
symptoms such as episodic memory loss of the hippocampal 
type are visible, but do not affect the daily life activities and 
do not support dementia diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 12996]
Also, in this stage the 
biomarkers existence from Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or 
imaging can proof AD pathology.

In the case of AD 
dementia, several serious cognitive symptoms are present

daily living consequences. 

[CHUNK 13002]
The last state would be 
considered as a threshold between the episodic memory 
modifications and in another at least cognitive domain. 

[CHUNK 13003]
Also, 
meaningful dementia threshold would be clinical trials or 
social/economic evaluations. 

[CHUNK 13004]
The third category is called 
Typical AD and includes the most common clinical 
phenotype of AD. 

[CHUNK 13005]
This phenotype is characterized by early 
and progressive episodic memory deficit that dominates in 
the following stages of the disease and coexists with other 
cognitive disorders (executive dysfunction, language, praxis, 
and complex visual processing impairments). 

[CHUNK 13006]
An incident 
integrates into this category if there is one or more in-vivo 
positive biomarker of AD pathology. 

[CHUNK 13007]
The case of Atypical 
AD characterizes certain clinical phenotype of Alzheimer’s 
pathology. 

[CHUNK 13008]
Such incidents include primary progressive non-
fluent aphasia, logopenic aphasia, frontal variant of AD, and 
posterior cortical atrophy. 

[CHUNK 13009]
Also, strong in vivo evidence of 
amyloidosis in the brain or in the CSF and one of the above 
clinical stages, the diagnosis of AD is certain. 

[CHUNK 13010]
The fifth 
category is called Mixed AD and refers to patients who 
fulfill the diagnostic criteria for Typical AD and present 
clinical and brain imaging/biological evidence with other 
diseases which have a similar pattern with AD, such as 
cerebrovascular or Lewy Bodies diseases. 

[CHUNK 13011]
The Preclinical 
States of AD are divided into two subcategories. 

[CHUNK 13012]
This case 
consists of an asymptomatic period between the early 
pathogenic events such as brain lesions of AD and the very 
first appearance of specific cognitive modifications. 

[CHUNK 13013]
The first 
subcategory is characterized as Asymptomatic at-risk state 
for AD, where brain amyloidosis or amyloidosis in the CSF 
is the primary evidence. 

[CHUNK 13014]
The second subcategory is called 
Presymptomatic AD, where patients are going to be evolved 
into AD. 

[CHUNK 13015]
It referred that this state mainly appears in families 
that are carriers of a rare autosomal dominant monogenic AD 
mutation. 

[CHUNK 13016]
Alzheimer’s Pathology covers the very first 
pathogenic events in the brain such as synaptic loss, and 
vascular amyloid deposits. 

[CHUNK 13017]
This term is used regardless of 
the clinical view. 

[CHUNK 13018]
Finally, the last category contains incidents 
with measurable MCI. 

[CHUNK 13019]
This state describes the case where 
there is no evidence for disease. 

[CHUNK 13020]
It is a term of exclusion for 
individuals who have memory symptoms that do not match 
with AD pattern or have negative biomarkers of AD 
pathology [8].  


[CHUNK 13021]
This review study aims to highlight the significance of 
several potential biomarkers of AD and their correlation with 
the attempt of an accurate diagnosis or even more an early 
prognosis. 

[CHUNK 13022]
The proposed diagnostic model covers a broad 
range of AD biomarkers such as genetic mutations, heredi-
tary risk factors, MCI and other comorbidities, referring both 
to the cases of sporadic and familial AD.

BIOMARKERS AND RISK FACTORS 
 When a patient presents visuospatial deficit and 
significant atrophy in the parietooccipital region on 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging  (MRI), we can easily 
conclude to neurodegeneration, leading to posterior cortical 
atrophy or optical dysfunction of AD. 

[CHUNK 13025]
Typically, symptoms 
can be mentioned such as logopenia, aphasia, frontal form of 
AD, language, praxis and complicated visual process and

neuropsychiatric changes in everyday activities [9-10]. 


[CHUNK 13031]
Furthermore, 
patients 
with 
presenile 
dementia 
and 
hemiparkinsonism have similar characteristics with AD 
pathology. 

[CHUNK 13032]
However, the coexistence of these two diseases is 
rare while the one condition will prevail against the other 
[11, 12].  


[CHUNK 13033]
At the same time, biomarkers that reveal high probability 
of AD due to MCI could be more accurate if Amyloid-β 
(Aβ) and neuronal injury biomarkers were also positively 
tested. 

[CHUNK 13034]
Exclusively the Aβ protein assessment can give us 
only an intermediary probability for developing AD due to 
MCI. 

[CHUNK 13035]
In the case where only one biomarker of neurologic 
damage exists and Aβ cannot be measured, then these 
patients will be assumed with a lower probability to develop 
AD. 


[CHUNK 13036]
In another study related to age and the way that age 
influent the aggravation of AD, the density of the 
pathological lesions are mentioned about the age of the 
subject [13, 14]. 

[CHUNK 13037]
Moreover, the age marker exists as a 
primate factor in several studies [8, 15, 16]. 

[CHUNK 13038]
In conjunction 
with the above, AD can also be divided into early onset 
familial AD where the disease is mainly developed before 
the age of 60 years. 

[CHUNK 13039]
In this case, the appearance of AD 
reveals a hereditary disease and is inherited in an autosomal 
dominant manner [9, 17, 18]. 


[CHUNK 13040]
Alzheimer’s disease is mainly characterized by the Aβ 
protein pathology which is found in amyloid precursor 
protein gene (APP, 21q21), of the long arm of chromosome 
21 [18]. 

[CHUNK 13041]
Aβ deposits lead to plaques creation, the amyloid 
fibrils accumulated in the cell’s outer space and grouped into 
globe shape. 

[CHUNK 13042]
Amyloid-β can also be deposited in media and 
adventitia of small and mid-sized arteries, in which case we 
refer to Cerebral Αmyloid Αngiopathy [19, 20]. 

[CHUNK 13043]
Besides, Aβ 
can be detected and quantified in CSF and plasma with 
Positron Emission Tomography scanning method, detecting 
fibrillar Aβ, while both techniques can detect neurological 
injury [21]. 

[CHUNK 13044]
Few individuals with DS mutation due to 
trisomy 21, show high levels of Aβ and present the classic 
pathology by the age of 50 [18]. 

[CHUNK 13045]
Another biomarker of 
neuronal injury is tau/phosphorylated tau protein. 

[CHUNK 13046]
When the 
two biomarkers Aβ and tau/phosphorylated tau proteins are 
positively measured, the probability of AD development 
increases [9, 22]. 

[CHUNK 13047]
Both Aβ and phosphorylated tau are 
conventional biomarkers for other disorders as well and can 
be detected in vivo or in vitro. 

[CHUNK 13048]
In vitro Scanning Tunneling 
Microscopy detects Ab (1-42) and two Photon Rayleigh 
Scattering Assay technique can be also used for tau 
detection. 

[CHUNK 13049]
In vivo with mMRI and Optical (Fluorescent) 
Imaging, we can detect Ab plaques [23]. 


[CHUNK 13050]
Moreover, biomarkers of neurological injury are 
considered the hippocampal volume or medial temporal lobe 
atrophy in MRI, the temporoparietal/precuneus hypometa-
bolism or the hypoperfusion on Positron Emission 
Tomography scanning method or single-photon emission 
computerized tomography [9]. 

[CHUNK 13051]
In a recent study, increased 
levels of Aβ and abnormal tau were detected in neocortical 
regions [24, 25], and the left precuneus, the superior 
temporal gyrus, and the fusiform gyrus have been also 
observed with a decreased volume on MRI studies [26]. 


[CHUNK 13052]
Family and population studies prove that individuals have 
increased the probability to develop AD with the fourth form 
of Apolipoprotein E gene of chromosome 14, while types 2 
and 3 of this gene do not affect their carriers. 

[CHUNK 13053]
Ages between 
65 and 75 are also at high risk to develop AD [11, 27, 28]. 

[CHUNK 13054]
In 
many recent studies, the CSF a-synuclein has been identified 
in samples of patients with AD or Parkinson’s disease and is 
possibly correlated to other biochemical biomarkers [12, 29]. 


[CHUNK 13055]
Lately, scientists are also focused on mitochondrial 
function. 

[CHUNK 13056]
The mitochondrion is a subcellular organelle that is 
responsible for ATP production and since neurons require 
high energy, low ATP levels signify cell’s death. 


[CHUNK 13057]
Mitochondrial fusion and fission occur continuously but in 
chaotic distributions and mutations in proteins that mediate 
their processes can cause irreparable loss. 

[CHUNK 13058]
There are a few 
proteins that are involved in mitochondrial dynamics like the 
Optic Atrophy-1, the Dynamin-Related Protein-1 (DLP-1), 
the Mitochondrial Fission 1, the Mitofusin-1 and Mitofusin-2 
[30]. 

[CHUNK 13059]
Optic Atrophy-1 is found in membrane’s inner-space 
and mediate in fusion process of the inner mitochondrial 
membrane, while DLP-1 is found in mitochondrial 
membrane’s interface to mediate during fission process. 


[CHUNK 13060]
Dynamin Related Protein-1 is believed to concentrate long 
oligomers which use Guanosine Triphosphate hydrolysis to 
constrict mitochondrial tubules during fission process. 


[CHUNK 13061]
Mitochondrial Fission 1 is an outer-membrane protein 
function with DLP-1 during the fission process. 

[CHUNK 13062]
Mitofusin-1 
and Mitofusin-2 belong to GTPases family, which can be 
found in the outer membrane space and mediate during the 
fusion process. 

[CHUNK 13063]
Mitofusin-1 and Mitofusin-2 are also 
responsible for mitochondrial lashing [23, 30]. 

[CHUNK 13064]
Furthermore, 
mutations in Presenilin-1 and Presenilin-2 proteins lead to 
AD expression [31]. 

[CHUNK 13065]
These two proteins encode amyloid 
precursor protein, and in the presence of Presenilin-1,2 
mutations individuals have high probability to develop AD. 


[CHUNK 13066]
Presenilin-1,2 mutations affect γ-secratase activity, which is 
responsible for disruption of amyloid precursor protein and 
Aβ cytotoxic accumulation [19, 28, 32]. 

[CHUNK 13067]
Moreover, 
mitochondrial phenotype present fragment, cristae structures 
are devastated, the number of mitochondria in dendrites is 
decreased, the mobility of mitochondria is decreased, and the 
KGDH-PDH-COX complexes present dysfunctions due to 
these proteins dysfunction. 

[CHUNK 13068]
Additionally, Aβ concentration 
interacts with DLP-1, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 activity 
increases and Kinesin protein interacts with mitochondria in 
the cerebral cortex [16-19]. 

[CHUNK 13069]
Individuals who inherit 
Presenilin-1,2 mutations present AD characteristics earlier 
than the age of 40-45. 

[CHUNK 13070]
Families with these mutations present 
AD heredity which attends the autosomal dominant pattern 
with 50% probability for each generation to develop AD [11, 
33, 34]. 

[CHUNK 13071]
These mutations lead to plaque creation, tangles, cell 
loss and dementia. 

[CHUNK 13072]
However, the percentage of AD patients 
due to genetic mutations are less than 2% of the total AD 
population [11]. 

[CHUNK 13073]
Education is referred as a controversial 
marker while individuals with high educational level have 
fewer probabilities to develop AD; the reason could be a 
network of highly stable neuronal synapses in their brain. 


[CHUNK 13074]
Important AD risk factors are the metal ions, which can 
affect negatively the AD development. 

[CHUNK 13075]
In any case that 
proteins and lipid membranes with toxic effect are affected, 
the main result is reactive oxygen species production or even 
more the presence of metalloprotein Aβ amyloid peptide.

[CHUNK 13079]
Zinc and Copper are released from brain’s cortical neurons 
and cause Aβ accumulation and Aβ deposits, through 
histidine amino acid interactions. 

[CHUNK 13080]
Additionally, Fe2+ and Cu2+ 
interactions with Aβ lead to H2O2 production, H2O2 is 
partially responsible for the oxidative action. 

[CHUNK 13081]
Also, Zn2+ and 
Cu2++ enhance Αβ interactions with cell’s membranes, 
increasing Aβ toxicity. 

[CHUNK 13082]
Furthermore, Fe3+ and Cu2+ interact 
with 
Aβ 
protein 
leading 
to 
oxidative 
stress, 
Aβ 
oligomerization lead to Calcium channels creation; these 
channels affect calcium homeostasis, causing oxidative 
stress [23, 35, 36]. 


[CHUNK 13083]
The p53 protein contributes to disease development, and 
specifically the unfolded p53 conformation leads to cell’s 
death. 

[CHUNK 13084]
Aβ peptides interact with HIPK-2 protein degradation 
affecting p53 conformation. 

[CHUNK 13085]
Proteins p53 and tau are also 
related and found in patients with AD. 

[CHUNK 13086]
p53 induces 
phosphorylation of human 2N4R tau causing neuronal death 
and other tauopathies [37-39]. 

[CHUNK 13087]
In a similar study, BRCA1 
and p53 accumulations have been detected in neurons at 
early AD onset [40]. 

[CHUNK 13088]
Even if it has been reported in a few 
studies, gender seems to have been abandoned as a potential 
AD marker, due to women longer life expectancy. 

[CHUNK 13089]
Also 
nationality does not appear to be a significant factor, 
however, certain people of the Asiatic origin appear to be 
differentiated [13]. 

[CHUNK 13090]
Additionaly, a new protein is under 
consideration, the YKL-40, which initially is characterized 
as brain cell injury biomarker, while it is increasingly 
detected in AD individuals between 50’s and 70’s years old 
[14]. 

[CHUNK 13091]
D-serine levels have been identified and measured in 
higher levels in the hippocampus and parietal cortex of AD 
patients and incriminated as a potential risk factor [41]. 

[CHUNK 13092]
Four 
miRNAs, the miR-31, miR-93, miR-143, and miR-146a are 
observed to be decreased in AD patient’s serum, therefore, 
are recently characterized as novel biomarkers of AD 
pathology and vascular dementia [42]. 

[CHUNK 13093]
Blood pressure has 
been 
formulated 
as 
precursor 
marker 
for 
disease 
manifestation. 

[CHUNK 13094]
Decades before the appearance of disease, 
high blood pressure can be observed when senile plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles, and hippocampal atrophy are already 
present [43]. 

[CHUNK 13095]
Also, it has been declared that the age and the 
blood pressure are related in AD development. 

[CHUNK 13096]
As mentioned 
above high blood pressure revealed decades before AD 
diagnosis, however in later life of an AD patient low levels 
of blood pressure occur. 

[CHUNK 13097]
Unfortunately, the way that blood 
pressure affects AD is still unknown, even though high blood 
pressure seems to be a lower risk factor for AD patients [44-
46]. 


[CHUNK 13098]
CONCLUSION 
Since a definitive and accurate diagnosis for AD and 
other related disorders can be made only at autopsy, 
neuroimaging 
techniques 
face 
challenges 
related 
to 
clinicopathologic heterogeneity. 

[CHUNK 13099]
Although all patients with 
AD progress through some form of an MCI phase before 
dementia, the converse is not true. 

[CHUNK 13100]
That is some patients who 
fulfill MCI criteria may have non-AD disease states [47]. 


[CHUNK 13101]
Furthermore, the rate at which individuals with MCI will 
develop dementia may also vary considerably. 

[CHUNK 13102]
Thus, 
although prodromal AD may be clinically identifiable as 
MCI [48], it is important to recognize the heterogeneity 
within this clinical construct. 

[CHUNK 13103]
Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma 
biomarkers, as well as amyloid imaging markers, can offer 
information about neuropathological symptoms of AD, when 
no evidence markers for hippocampal volume loss can be 
accurately exported from MRI scanning [49]. 

[CHUNK 13104]
Especially 
structrural MRI biomarkers conclude to major variations 
among young and elderly populations, associating different 
neuropathological underpinnings of cognitive impairment in 
the very old populations [50]. 


[CHUNK 13105]
Latest studies reveal also the significance of the nerve 
growth factor precursor protein (proNGF) with cognitive 
impairement, underlying the effectiveness of this diagnostic 
biomarker [51]. 


[CHUNK 13106]
In AD patients, who have been tested in structural 
imaging biomarker’s detection, left and right hippocampal 
gradings, cortical thicknesses of the left precuneus, left 
superior temporal sulcus and right anterior part of the 
parahippocampal gyrus, offer 72% accuracy in AD diagnosis 
[52]. 

[CHUNK 13107]
Additionally, genetic mutations affect less than 2% of 
total AD patients and age seems to play a dominant role in 
the aggravation of disease even though it has been observed 
that the first lesions begin at least 20 years earlier from the 
first symptoms. 

[CHUNK 13108]
The educational level shows some resistance 
in the disease, but it should not be considered as a valid 
marker. 

[CHUNK 13109]
Mitochondrial dynamics is a latest crucial element in 
the puzzle of AD etiology and development, concerning 
metal ions concentrations in the brain and metal ions 
interactions with Aβ protein, increasing cells and brain 
toxicity [53-55]. 


[CHUNK 13110]
It is obvious that early diagnosis of AD could be a cost 
effective 
approach 
to 
prevent 
its 
irreversible 
and 
uncontrollable consequences. 

[CHUNK 13111]
In every case, a correct 
diagnosis needs to be performed before the underlying 
pathology has become severe enough to present itself 
clinically [56-58].

Abstract: Background: The only conclusive way to diagnose Alzheimer’s is to carry out brain 
autopsy of the patient’s brain tissue and ascertain whether the subject had Alzheimer’s or any other 
form of dementia. 

[CHUNK 13291]
However, due to the non-feasibility of such methods, to diagnose and conclude 
the conditions, medical practitioners use tests that examine a patient’s mental ability. 


[CHUNK 13292]
Objective: Accurate diagnosis at an early stage is the need of the hour for initiation of therapy. 

[CHUNK 13293]
The 
cause for most Alzheimer’s cases still remains unknown except where genetic distinctions have 
been observed. 

[CHUNK 13294]
Thus, a standard drug regimen ensues in every Alzheimer’s patient, irrespective of 
the cause, which may not always be beneficial in halting or reversing the disease progression. 

[CHUNK 13295]
To 
provide a better life to such patients by suppressing existing symptoms, early diagnosis, curative 
therapy, site-specific delivery of drugs, and application of hyphenated methods like artificial intelli-
gence need to be brought into the main field of Alzheimer’s therapeutics. 


[CHUNK 13296]
Methods: In this review, we have compiled existing hypotheses to explain the cause of the disease, 
and highlighted gene therapy, immunotherapy, peptidomimetics, metal chelators, probiotics and 
quantum dots as advancements in the existing strategies to manage Alzheimer’s. 


[CHUNK 13297]
Conclusion: Biomarkers, brain-imaging, and theranostics, along with artificial intelligence, are 
understood to be the future of the management of Alzheimer’s.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major cause of dementia, is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disorder. 

[CHUNK 13301]
Dementia includes 
memory loss and difficulties with thinking, language and 
problem-solving skills. 

[CHUNK 13302]
As per the WHO update, on epide-
miology of AD in 2013, the number of people suffering from 
dementia worldwide is likely to triple by 2050 which was 
approximately 35.6 million in 2010. 

[CHUNK 13303]
The incidence of de-
mentia increases with age, approximately 5-8% are affected 
over age of 65, the number increases to 25-50% as the age 
rises over 85. 

[CHUNK 13304]
The prevalence of AD for men was lower than 
that for women by 19-29%. 

[CHUNK 13305]
China, USA, India, Japan, Ger-
many, Russia, France and Brazil were the nine countries in 
descending order of incidence of people suffering from de-
mentia in 2010, and the numbers more than 1 million 
(USFDA 2013) [1]. 

[CHUNK 13306]
There is a protein formed in the brain to 
form structures called 'plaques' and 'tangles.

(Aβ42) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of

hyper phosphorylated tau are the indicators of AD. 

[CHUNK 13309]
These 
proteins are the precursors for the loss of connections be-
tween nerve cells, and eventually to the death of nerve cells 
and loss of brain tissue. 

[CHUNK 13310]
We have summarized the patho-
physiology, current strategies and future approaches for im-
provement of the treatment and diagnosis of AD in our re-
view. 

[CHUNK 13311]
We aim to give an insight into the current status of 
diagnosis and future directions to overcome the associated 
limitations with artificial intelligence. 

[CHUNK 13312]
Several proposed 
theories explain the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration 
and cause of dementia and are explained in brief in the next 
section with current advances in understanding.

Aβ Plaque Associated Neurodegeneration 
 
According to this hypothesis, Aβ plaques are formed and 
get deposited in different regions of the brain. 

[CHUNK 13316]
These plaques 
are recognised as foreign material by the brain initiating an 
inflammatory and immune response by activating the micro-
glia and release of cytokines, which eventually lead to cell 
death and neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 13317]
The Aβ plaque comprises of 
Aβ peptides obtained from amyloid precursor protein (APP) 
by the enzymatic cleavage via secretases (α, β and γ) [2]. 


[CHUNK 13318]
The primary step in the generation of Aβ plaque is the cleav-

age of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase to 
produce a C-terminal membrane attached with fragments of 
89 or 99 amino acids. 

[CHUNK 13322]
This β-secretase includes BACE 1 (β-
site APP cleaving enzyme), which is also called Asp2 or 
memapsin2. 

[CHUNK 13323]
APP is cleaved at β-sites Asp1 and Glu11 by 
BACE 1. 

[CHUNK 13324]
The C-terminal membrane-bound fragment of 99 
amino acid residues is further cleaved by γ-secretase to pro-
duce Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 isoforms.

γ-secretase mainly in-

Aβ1-40 is the

may give rise to Aβ1-42, which aggregates easily and forms 
the plaque due to two additional amino acids isoleucine and 
alanine [3]. 

[CHUNK 13327]
This change in the cleavage pattern happens due 
to mutations in the APP gene, presenelin 1, presenelin 2 
genes or apolipoprotein E (APOE4) gene. 

[CHUNK 13328]
Apart from the 
genetic mutations, many neuropeptides are likely to be in-
volved in the formation of the plaque for e.g. 

[CHUNK 13329]
low levels of 
corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), somatostatin and 
neuropeptide Y levels whereas higher levels of Angiotensin 
II are likely to be involved in either irregular cleavage of the 
APP or impaired removal of Aβ1-42 fragment [2]. 

[CHUNK 13330]
Both Aβ 
and tau aggregates and cause impaired synaptic plasticity 
and neuronal cell death [4]. 

[CHUNK 13331]
However, there has been a lot of 
controversy over this hypothesis and a recent report indicates 
that drugs that act to inhibit amyloid plaque formation show 
no effect in reversing or halting the cognitive decline. 

[CHUNK 13332]
This 
suggests that either the hypothesis is incorrect or the brain 
becomes refractory to treatment after a certain time. 

[CHUNK 13333]
Thus, 
one should focus on finding therapeutic interventions that act 
on non-amyloid targets like tau proteins, inflammation, oxi-
dative stress, etc. 

[CHUNK 13334]
[5]. 


[CHUNK 13335]
1.1.2. 

[CHUNK 13336]
Neurofibrillary Degeneration 
 
Tau proteins are micro tubular neuronal proteins. 

[CHUNK 13337]
The tau 
proteins have a microtubule binding domain, which is in-
volved in polymerization and stabilization of the microtubule 
assembly to maintain the integrity of the cytoskeleton. 

[CHUNK 13338]
This 
binding is regulated by phosphorylation of the serine/ 
threonine residues by a variety of kinases like Fyn Kinase, 
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and cyclin-dependent 
kinase-5 (CDK5). 

[CHUNK 13339]
CDK5 plays a potential role in the forma-
tion of neurofibrillary tangles. 

[CHUNK 13340]
Aβ activates calpain and de-
regulates p35 which is an activator of CDK5. 

[CHUNK 13341]
Due to cytoso-
lic calcium overload, p35 splits into p25, which hyperacti-
vates cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and leads to hyper 
phosphorylation of tau [6]. 

[CHUNK 13342]
Hyper phosphorylation results in 
decreased affinity of the tau proteins to microtubules. 

[CHUNK 13343]
The 
hyper phosphorylated tau forms NFTs and gets deposited in 
the cytosol and can no longer perform the function of main-
taining the structure of the cell. 

[CHUNK 13344]
Moreover, this deposition 
affects normal cellular function like synaptic transmission, 
axonal transport, signal transduction and the cell undergo 
degeneration gradually. 

[CHUNK 13345]
The reason stated for the hyper 
phosphorylation is a mutation in the tau genes or dysregula-
tion of kinases as mentioned below and phosphatases which 
catalyze the phosphorylation process [7]. 


[CHUNK 13346]
1.1.3. 

[CHUNK 13347]
Synaptic Dysfunction and Neurotransmitter Imbal-
ance 
 
The cholinergic system is involved in the process of cog-
nition. 

[CHUNK 13348]
The dysfunction of this system is responsible for 
various dementias, one of which is AD. 

[CHUNK 13349]
Cholinergic neurons 
in the nucleus basalis of Meynert selectively display the 
deposition of amyloid plaque and NFTs, eventually undergo 
degeneration due to the initiation of pro-inflammatory events 
as described earlier, which further deteriorate cognition. 


[CHUNK 13350]
Cholinergic deficit also alters the permeability of the blood 
brain barrier causing erroneous transportation of metabolites 
and hampering the removal of amyloid plaque, worsening 
the disease condition [8]. 

[CHUNK 13351]
Alteration in Ca2+ permeable n-
acetylcholine-receptor (nAChR) can cause impairment in 
synaptic integrity. 

[CHUNK 13352]
In hippocampal and cortical synaptic re-
gion Aβ exhibit maximum binding to α7- and α4β2-nAChRs 
[3]. 

[CHUNK 13353]
The expression of choline acetyl transferase is reduced 
and that of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is increased, con-
tributing to the depletion of acetylcholine and worsening of 
dementia. 

[CHUNK 13354]
AchE also interacts with Aβ peptide and promotes 
plaque formation [9]. 

[CHUNK 13355]
It has been observed that degeneration 
of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coerulus is also related 
to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 13356]
Further it is 
reported that noradrenergic receptors are densely present on 
the astrocytes, the activation of which improves synaptic 
plasticity and hence learning and memory [10]. 

[CHUNK 13357]
Recently, it 
has been reported that serotonin is equally involved in AD 
pathogenesis. 

[CHUNK 13358]
There is a loss of serotonergic neurons from 
the brainstem of many AD patients and the levels of this 
neurotransmitter are also found to be less. 

[CHUNK 13359]
The serotonergic 
cortical input from the midbrain raphe nuclei, is responsible 
for modulation of cortical plasticity and formation of mem-
ory. 

[CHUNK 13360]
A dysfunction of this pathway causes memory loss [11]. 


[CHUNK 13361]
Glutamate by acting on the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid 
(AMPA) receptor is a key neurotransmitter in maintaining 
synaptic plasticity. 

[CHUNK 13362]
An imbalance in the glutamate/glutamine 
metabolism causes persistent depolarization of the neurons 
resulting in excitotoxicity leading to synaptic injury. 

[CHUNK 13363]
Apart 
from this, Aβ induces hypersensitivity of NMDA receptors 
and also disrupts the regulatory control of NMDA activity 
causing excitotoxicity [12]. 

[CHUNK 13364]
There is also a close association 
of GABA and serotonin in the dorsal raphae nuclei, a region 
of the brain stem that has many clusters of serotonergic neu-
rons. 

[CHUNK 13365]
A study reports that 5HT6R antagonist improves cogni-
tive decline by enhancing serotonin levels via GABAergic 
neurons. 

[CHUNK 13366]
The same molecule also reduces the formation of 
amyloid plaque since it reduces the gamma-secretase activity 
without having any effect on β secretase [13]. 

[CHUNK 13367]
Loss of inhibi-
tory control of GABAergic neurons on the cholinergic and 
glutamatergic neurons is linked to synaptic injury in AD 
patients. 

[CHUNK 13368]
Thus, a complex interplay of several neurotransmit-
ters is essential to keep the cognition intact. 

[CHUNK 13369]
An imbalance in 
any one of the above neurotransmitters may contribute to 
further deterioration of AD symptoms. 
 


[CHUNK 13370]
Aβ, tau, and AD genetic risk factors affect dendritic in-
tegrity and disease progression [14]. 

[CHUNK 13371]
The amyloid plaque 
formation starts at the post synapse. 

[CHUNK 13372]
Tau phosphorylation is a 
protective mechanism against toxic amyloid deposition. 


[CHUNK 13373]
Phosphorylated tau dissociates from the post synaptic site 
and becomes a substrate for other kinases resulting in hyper-
phosphorylation at various sites. 

[CHUNK 13374]
This hyperphosphorylated 
tau spreads gradually from the post synaptic site to the den-
drites and the cell body, finally from the axon to other neu-
rons by intra-axonal connections. 

[CHUNK 13375]

1.1.4. 

[CHUNK 13381]
Neuroinflammation 
 
Neuro-inflammation plays a central role in the patho-
genesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 13382]
Acute inflammation has a protective role in 
defending against brain injury such as the presence of Aβ 
plaque. 

[CHUNK 13383]
However, persistent activation of microglia makes 
them incapable of removing the plaque, but their ability to 
release pro inflammatory cytokines is retained, resulting in 
an imbalance between the pro and anti-inflammatory cytoki-
nes. 

[CHUNK 13384]
Aβ deposits activate various Toll like receptors (TLR2, 
TLR4 and TLR6), as well as their co-receptors, including 
CD36, CD14 and CD47 expressed by microglia. 

[CHUNK 13385]
On the de-
tection of microbes, proinflammatory cytokines of IL-1β 
family are produced by the immune system, including cyto-
kine IL-1β and IL-18. 

[CHUNK 13386]
These cytokines are expressed by 
caspase-1 or caspase-8 on activation. 

[CHUNK 13387]
Inflammasome like 
NLR (‘Nod-like receptor’) family or PYHIN (‘pyrin and 
HIN domain–containing’) assist activation of caspase-1. 


[CHUNK 13388]
NLRP3 is the primary inflammasome which can sense Ab 
aggregates. 

[CHUNK 13389]
These proinflammatory cytokines can impair 
dendritic spines and also disrupt microglial clearance of Aβ. 


[CHUNK 13390]
Neuron and glial cell on an encounter with proinflammatory 
cytokines express inducible isoforms of NO synthase, which 
enhances the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO). 

[CHUNK 13391]
This increases 
the peptide’s ability to aggregate and makes it more potent in 
suppressing synaptic plasticity [16]. 

[CHUNK 13392]
Under the influence of 
these cytokines, CDKs get activated causing hyperphos-
phorylation of tau and increase the formation of Aβ plaque 
as discussed earlier. 

[CHUNK 13393]
Due to the dysregulation of GABAergic 
mechanism in AD, the inhibitory role of GABA on activated 
microglia is also lost which further contributes to the release 
of pro-inflammatory cytokines [17]. 

[CHUNK 13394]
Other cells like endothe-
lial cells, oligodendrocytes and neurons can also cause neu-
roinflammation. 

[CHUNK 13395]
Several inflammation protective molecules 
are present in neuron, like fractalkine, the complement de-
fence protein CD59 and CD200. 

[CHUNK 13396]
Immune molecules like IL-
1β, IL-6 and CCL2 are produced by brain endothelial cells 
against Aβ plaque [18]. 


[CHUNK 13397]
1.1.5. 

[CHUNK 13398]
Infectious Disease Hypothesis 
 
Aβ has been attributed to have antimicrobial properties. 

[CHUNK 13399]
It 
has been suggested that neurons infected by Spirochetes and 
other pathogens like Chlamydia and HSV-1 have more of Aβ 
deposition and NFTs. 

[CHUNK 13400]
Thus, the persistent untreated infection 
could be one of the causes of AD [19]. 

[CHUNK 13401]
In the presence of 
infection, the immune system gets activated. 

[CHUNK 13402]
A component of 
the innate immune system referred to as “Toll like proteins” 
as mentioned above, is activated due to it [20]. 


[CHUNK 13403]
1.1.6. 

[CHUNK 13404]
Gut Microbiome Disruption 
 
Brain and gut have a bidirectional communication via the 
brain-gut metabolic axis. 

[CHUNK 13405]
Several studies have established a 
positive correlation between AD and microbial disruption in 
the gut. 

[CHUNK 13406]
Disturbance in the gut microflora results in increased 
production of secondary cytotoxic bile acid, mainly deoxy-
cholic acid, which can cross the blood brain barrier and get 
deposited in the brain leading to apoptosis, generation of 
reactive oxygen species, inflammation and neurodegenera-
tion [21]. 

[CHUNK 13407]
Alternatively, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome 
causes systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, insulin 
resistance, which are all related to the pathogenesis of AD 
[22]. 

[CHUNK 13408]
Gut microbes influence the formation, absorption and 
transport of serotonin and GABA in the brain, moreover 
some bacterial species influence the formation of amyloid 
plaque which initiates the inflammatory cascade and hence 
susceptibility to AD [23]. 

[CHUNK 13409]
Thus, a faulty gut microbiome along 
with other factors contributes to the progression of AD. 
 


[CHUNK 13410]
NO is secreted on activation of N-Methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptors by glutamate and acts as a primary neu-
rotransmitter of noradrenergic, noncholinergic and enteric 
nervous system. 

[CHUNK 13411]
Gut microbes like Biﬁdobacteria and Lacto-
bacilli convert nitrite and nitrate to NO. 

[CHUNK 13412]
Gut bacilli and 
Streptomyces can also synthesize NO by their NO synthetase 
(NOS). 

[CHUNK 13413]
Alteration in the activity of any of these gut mi-
crobes along with increase nitrate intake, can lead to over-
production of NO, which can cause axonal degeneration, 
neuro inflammation and neurodegenerative disorders [24]. 
 


[CHUNK 13414]
Alteration in microbiome can lead to the secretion of 
immunogenic lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and amyloids 
which can diffuse across brain and aggravate AD symptoms. 


[CHUNK 13415]
Receptor for advanced glycosylation products (RAGE) me-
diate amyloid brain influx across blood brain barrier (BBB) 
and is controlled by chaperones and apolipoprotein E and J. 
Low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 is known 
to control amyloid clearance. 

[CHUNK 13416]
Impairment in all these trans-
portation mechanisms is associated with AD. 

[CHUNK 13417]
Moreover, 
prion like proteins can cause penetration of monocyte trans 
endothelial which can enhance the inflammation. 

[CHUNK 13418]
Due to the 
alteration in the gut microbiome and transportation, the bac-
teria derived amyloids may leak from gastro intestinal track 
and escalate the level of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, 
IL10, IL6, IL17A, IL12p40, IL23p19, and IL22). 

[CHUNK 13419]
This may 
further increase the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
and activate signalling of nuclear factor- kB (NF-kB). 

[CHUNK 13420]
As a 
result, proinflammatory miRNA-34a is up regulated, causing 
downregulation of TREM-2 (trigger receptor expressed in 
microglial/myeloid cell-2), which can cause deposition of 
Aβ-42 peptide [25]. 

[CHUNK 13421]
Certain viral and bacterial pathogens can 
also cause AD. 

[CHUNK 13422]
It was identified that patients infected with 
bacteria (like Chlamydia pneumonia, Borrelia burgdorferi 
and Helicobacter pylori) showed increased levels of Aβ-40 
and Aβ-42 as well as an increase in levels of inflammatory 
mediators associated with AD [26]. 


[CHUNK 13423]
1.1.7. 

[CHUNK 13424]
Genetic Mutations 
 
APOE gene has been closely related to the incidence of 
AD in most cases [27]. 

[CHUNK 13425]
Other genes involved are presenilin 
1, presenelin 2 and mutations in β amyloid precursor protein 
[28]. 

[CHUNK 13426]
Due to mutations in the genes mentioned above, the 
person becomes susceptible to AD. 


[CHUNK 13427]
1.1.8. 

[CHUNK 13428]
Oxidative Stress 
 
Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have long 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of early AD. 

[CHUNK 13429]
Decreased 
level of cytochrome c oxidase can cause dysfunction of mi-
tochondria. 

[CHUNK 13430]
Additionally, hyper excitation of glycogen syn-
thase kinase (GSK-3) due to oxidative stress (OS) can alter 
the permeability of mitochondria. 

[CHUNK 13431]
This could lead to over-
production of ROS [24].

copper may bind to the Aβ plaque and produce ROS. 

[CHUNK 13436]
ROS 
thus produced brings about oxidative change in the Aβ pep-
tide itself making its removal difficult and also cause lipid 
and protein oxidation of the cell membrane making it perme-
able and hence susceptible to degeneration [24, 29, 30]. 

[CHUNK 13437]
Cal-
cium ions storage in the endoplasmic reticulum can be im-
paired by Aβ plaque, which increases calcium levels in the 
cytosol. 

[CHUNK 13438]
This increase in calcium levels depletes glutathione 
and over-accumulation of ROS inside the cells. 

[CHUNK 13439]
Hyperactiva-
tion of N-Methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors 
(NMDARs) can also lead to increase calcium influx by pro-
moting cell permeability, which leads to the formation of 
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and ROS. 

[CHUNK 13440]
Aβ proteins can 
directly activate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phos-
phate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase to initiate the synthesis of 
free radicals [31]. 


[CHUNK 13441]
1.1.9. 

[CHUNK 13442]
Autophagy 
 
It is known as a housekeeping system or the waste man-
agement system of the cell. 

[CHUNK 13443]
It involves engulfing of the dam-
aged proteins or cell constituents. 

[CHUNK 13444]
Nucleation is the first step 
in this process by which a phagophore is formed. 

[CHUNK 13445]
Then the 
phagophore extends to enclose all the damaged proteins or 
the dysfunctional organelles. 

[CHUNK 13446]
This leads to formation of 
closed vacuoles known as Autophagosomes. 

[CHUNK 13447]
Finally, the 
autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes 
which degrade all its contents. 

[CHUNK 13448]
Various growing factors for 
AD like presenelin 1 proteins, oxidative stress, tau neurofi-
brillary tangles can cause dysfunction of autophagic vacuoles 
and hence can contribute in the pathogenesis of AD [32, 33].

Diagnostics of Alzheimer’s Disease 
 
Currently, the diagnosis of AD is primarily dependent on 
positron emission tomography (PET) of tracer molecules and 
analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein [34]. 

[CHUNK 13453]
Phos-
phorylated tau 181 (P-tau181) can be used as a confirmatory 
and prognostic biomarker for the diagnosis of AD. 

[CHUNK 13454]
It gets 
deposited in the brain and secreted in CSF which crosses 
blood brain barrier to enter the blood where it can be used as 
a biomarker for AD [35, 36]. 

[CHUNK 13455]
Recently, the diagnostic accu-
racy has increased with a specialized PET scan, which exhib-
its 100% specificity and 96% sensitivity in AD as well as in 
patients with the milder condition. 

[CHUNK 13456]
Florbetapir, florbetaben 
and flutemetamol are used as PET ligands for diagnosis, but 
not widely used due to its high cost. 

[CHUNK 13457]
Examination of CSF for 
p-tau, Aβ42 and total tau protein content is less costly. 

[CHUNK 13458]
This 
method has an accuracy of 85-90% in diagnosing AD, but 
needs long duration for obtaining results due to invasive

method (lumbar puncture) and the dearth of laboratory facili-
ties involved in the analysis of fluid. 

[CHUNK 13466]
However, both PET 
imaging and CSF analysis exhibit similar accuracy, and sug-
gest that the optimum test for the diagnosis will depend upon 
patient/provider preference, cost and availability of facilities 
[37]. 

[CHUNK 13467]
PET scanning and CSF analysis revealed that the 
pathological changes are initiated two decades before the 
appearance of symptoms [38]. 

[CHUNK 13468]
Due to this reason, the diag-
nosis of AD on the onset of symptoms would not be very 
helpful as pathological changes and cognitive impairment 
would have already accelerated to higher stages. 

[CHUNK 13469]
As a result, 
for better diagnosis and treatment, we suggest the use of 
biomarkers, which can help in early detection of AD as men-
tioned below.

NEWER STRATEGIES IN EARLY DETECTION OF 
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE

[CHUNK 13472]
Biomarkers 
 
A biomarker is an indicator considered for evaluation of 
any normal biological as well as pathogenic processes and 
pharmacological effects of any therapy. 

[CHUNK 13473]
In the case of AD, a 
biomarker can be used to assess the overall health and dis-
eased condition of aged patients [39, 40]. 

[CHUNK 13474]
An extracellular 
deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein and aggregated form of 
hyper phosphorylated tau protein in the brain are two main 
pathological characteristics of AD [41]. 

[CHUNK 13475]
Recently all the im-
portant molecular biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease were 
critically discussed for their status and prospects by Lashley 
et al. 

[CHUNK 13476]
(2018) [42]. 
 


[CHUNK 13477]
They detailed the use of cerebrospinal fluid and blood 
biomarkers with positron emission tomography (PET) imag-
ing techniques for Aβ42 and phosphorylated tau concentra-
tion, axonal and synaptic degeneration, glial activation, trans 
active response DNA-binding protein 43 and α-synuclein 
pathology determination. 

[CHUNK 13478]
Fillit (2018) of the Alzheimer's 
Drug Discovery Foundation recently emphasized the need 
for new biomarkers for AD in Scientific American [43]. 


[CHUNK 13479]
With increased emphasis on drugs targeting beta-amyloid 
proteins all these years, they have not yet yielded many posi-
tive results. 

[CHUNK 13480]
Although prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers 
are available for Alzheimer’s disease, only a limited number 
of patients have been tested with these clinically available 
biomarkers due to the high cost and restricted access. 

[CHUNK 13481]
Thus, 
studies are suggesting to come up with an affordable and 
feasible blood test to be performed in any clinical setup cre-
ating a big impact on AD patients. 


[CHUNK 13482]
2.2. 

[CHUNK 13483]
Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Proteins 
 
More specific to AD, CSF measures of Aβ1-42, t-tau, and 
p-tau and molecular imaging using PET have become widely 
adopted with improving assays and ligands. 

[CHUNK 13484]
Some of the 
previous studies carried out in vitro and human trials have 
indicated the role of non-essential heavy metals cadmium 
(Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As) in causing 
Aβ protein aggregation along with worrisome levels of tau 
hyper phosphorylation [44]. 

[CHUNK 13485]
An ELISA assay called as 
INNOTEST has been used for two decades for quantification 
of t-tau, p-tau and Aβ42 in CSF which gives a unique ‘Alz-
heimer’s CSF profile’ where an increased level of t-tau and 
p-tau is observed with decreased Aβ42 level [45, 46]. 

[CHUNK 13486]
C- 
reactive protein (CRP) levels are majorly associated with 
ApoE genotype and the CSF amyloid levels [47]. 

[CHUNK 13487]
Mean CRP 
levels decreased significantly in AD in study conducted by 
O'Bryant et al. 

[CHUNK 13488]
(2009) [48]. 

[CHUNK 13489]
They also evaluated the link be-
tween CRP and AD among Mexican Americans. 

[CHUNK 13490]
In the men-
tioned study they observed decreased levels of CRP among 
Mexican American AD patients [49]. 
 


[CHUNK 13491]
The CRP has a role in amyloid pathology as studied and 
shown in APP/PS1 (amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1) 
mice; pentameric CRP dissociation takes place into mono-
meric forms prompted by amyloid plaque [50, 51]. 

[CHUNK 13492]
Mono-
meric CRP acts as a linker between vascular trauma and in-
flammation and also is associated with other events like 
plaque generation, neuronal injury, and dementia [52]. 

[CHUNK 13493]
There 
are many studies proving the statistical influence of the 
ApoE genotype on the peripheral CRP levels. 

[CHUNK 13494]
Hubacek et al. 


[CHUNK 13495]
(2010) showed that ApoE4 genotype carriers have lower 
levels of plasma CRP than in ApoE3 carriers [53]. 

[CHUNK 13496]
Elevated 
CRP is found to be associated with decreased cognition in 
“The Project in Sado for Total Health” (PROST) study in the 
Japanese population. 

[CHUNK 13497]
The present study revealed a clear as-
sociation between serum CRP concentration and cognitive 
impairment in a community-dwelling elderly population in 
Japan [54]. 
 


[CHUNK 13498]
A range of other markers namely vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1), interferon gamma-induced 
protein 10 (IP-10), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 
(sVCAM-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), 
and complement component 1q (C1q) have been strongly 
associated independently of patient’s age with the pathologi-
cal tau levels. 

[CHUNK 13499]
Thus, the effect of aging on CSF marker levels 
vary for each of these molecules. 

[CHUNK 13500]
The CSF tau level in-
creases in the subsequent stages of AD accompanied by 
events such as neuronal death owing to inflammatory signal-
ling in response to tissue damage. 

[CHUNK 13501]
It is concluded that CSF 
levels of these markers correspond to the pathological activ-
ity in the brain only in the later stages with cognitive demand 
tasks in AD [55]. 
 


[CHUNK 13502]
For biomarkers estimation from CSF sample, it has limi-
tations with respect to invasive process and high cost and 
limited access for PET studies. 

[CHUNK 13503]
CSF fluid collection by lum-
bar puncture causes nausea, backache and weakness in aged 
people. 

[CHUNK 13504]
It is essential to identify new biomarkers in other less 
invasive and easily collectible body fluids like serum, urine 
etc. 

[CHUNK 13505]
With blood samples being used for diagnosis, it can help 
in analysing different types of blood cells (mononuclear 
cells, lymphocytes, monocytes or platelets), which can be 
categorically associated with AD pathologies [56]. 

[CHUNK 13506]
Recently 
there has been a surge in finding blood biomarkers appropri-
ate for repeated evaluations throughout the disease progres-
sion over a time-frame for an interventional/treatment study 
[57]. 

[CHUNK 13507]
Other technical advancements in mass spectrometry-
based methods and highly sensitive immunoassays hold 
great promises for blood biomarkers, which can be imple-
mented for screening neurodegeneration and amyloid deposi-
tion in the brain [58].

Blood and Urine Biomarkers of AD 
 
Plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels are now established bio-
markers for AD. 

[CHUNK 13512]
In AD transgenic mouse models, plasma 
and CSF levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 increase with age but later 
decrease with Aβ accumulation in the brain leading to onset 
of cognitive impairment. 

[CHUNK 13513]
Schupf et al. 

[CHUNK 13514]
(2008) determined the 
predictive value of Aβ levels in elderly people, and investi-
gated the change in these biomarkers over time with the on-
set of cognitive impairment or AD. 

[CHUNK 13515]
Monitoring the levels, it 
was seen that those with increased Aβ42 levels over the fol-
low-up period, compared with decreasing levels were three 
times more likely to develop AD [59]. 

[CHUNK 13516]
Yang et al. 

[CHUNK 13517]
(2018) 
showed increased risks of AD in individuals with high arse-
nic or low dimethylarsinic acid percentage with a study 
based on propensity-score match [44]. 

[CHUNK 13518]
In another study, an 
immuno-­‐infrared-­‐sensor was used for the extraction of the 
total Aβ fraction from plasma samples, wherein the bio-
marker amide I band were significantly lower for AD indi-
viduals. 

[CHUNK 13519]
Amide I biomarker could detect AD before its clini-
cal diagnosis and without dementia symptoms in individuals. 


[CHUNK 13520]
The test had a positive likelihood ratio of 7.9 (ESTHER: 
Alzheimer’s society in Toronto), which indicated good evi-
dence of this biomarker to identify AD in the general popula-
tion [60]. 


[CHUNK 13521]

[CHUNK 13522]
Lipid Biomarkers of AD Present in the Blood 
 
Brain lipids are important molecules as they play various 
biological and physiological roles in impulse conduction and 
cell signalling in the central nervous system (CNS). 

[CHUNK 13523]
Out of 
all the brain lipids, the most abundant are cholesterol, cera-
mides, glucosyl ceramides, phosphatidylcholine, sphingo-
myelin, and sulfatides [61, 62]. 

[CHUNK 13524]
Besides them, cholesterol 
oxide derivatives and other long chain derivatives of fatty 
acids including prostaglandins, leukotrienes and neuropro-
tectins are present [63, 64]. 

[CHUNK 13525]
The levels of sphingolipids are 
also affected (decreased) in AD [65]. 

[CHUNK 13526]
These brain lipids are 
found in the glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), mi-
croglial cells, and neurons of the CNS. 

[CHUNK 13527]
They are also present 
in myelin and helps in the nervous influx by favouring good 
conduction. 

[CHUNK 13528]
The identification of above-mentioned lipid 
biomarkers may be explored as a less invasive diagnostic 
method and as predictors of AD for future disease progres-
sion and treatment response. 

[CHUNK 13529]
Biochemical and physical 
methods are frequently used; however histological and cyto-
logical methods are also possible for lipid characterization 
and quantification since lot of dyes are being used in tissues 
and cells to identify and trace various types of lipids [66]. 


[CHUNK 13530]

[CHUNK 13531]
Genetic Markers 
 
AD is complex and heterogeneous and is inherited ac-
cording to Mendelian genetics. 

[CHUNK 13532]
There are more than 160 mu-
tations reported in three important genes which are responsi-
ble for coding amyloid precursor, presenilin 1, and presenilin 
2 [67]. 

[CHUNK 13533]
ε4 allele of the APOE gene which occurs with a fre-
quency of 14% is the other major risk factor for developing 
AD; and its frequency increases to ~40% in AD patients and 
is also related to the onset of earlier age AD dementia and 
increased Aβ pathology. 

[CHUNK 13534]
Amyloid plaques are superabundant 
in ε4 carriers, with lower Aβ1-42 concentration in CSF, with 
increased Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) shown bound to Aβ 
aggregates on PET imaging [4]. 

[CHUNK 13535]
Familial Alzheimer's disease 
is inherited from parents and it currently accounts for < 1% 
of the AD burden [45]. 

[CHUNK 13536]
Late-onset AD is genetically and 
etiologically heterogeneous in nature, with innumerable 
genes and environmental factors involved in disease progres-
sion rate and risk. 

[CHUNK 13537]
The strongest and most reliable genetic 
association involves the epsilon 4 (ε4) allele at the ApoE 
locus for increased risk of late-onset AD [68, 69]. 

[CHUNK 13538]
The ApoE 
gene encodes for a protein responsible for lipid transport; ε4 
allele carriers have increased deposition of amyloid and also 
show adverse effects on memory and executive function 
[70]. 

[CHUNK 13539]
However, the genotyping of the ApoE locus is compli-
cated as the allelic denomination is determined by a pair of 
polymorphisms thus a small sample of blood or a cheek 
swab, can be used for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolation 
and thus the determination of ApoE genotype. 

[CHUNK 13540]
From now 
onwards, the association between the ApoE ε4 allele carriers 
and the occurrence of AD is well-accepted as it also lowers 
the overall age for onset for AD [66, 67], but does not hold 
any specific inference for the individual carrier. 

[CHUNK 13541]
Therefore, it 
is to add more accuracy to a complete biomarker panel for 
AD [71]. 


[CHUNK 13542]

[CHUNK 13543]
Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) 
 
The decline in memory with the reduction in hippocam-
pal volume (HV) corresponding with high Aβ levels has 
been already reported in healthy individuals; Lim et al. 


[CHUNK 13544]
(2013) showed that BDNF Val66Met worsens these condi-
tions more in the preclinical stage of AD [72]. 

[CHUNK 13545]
In the study 
conducted in healthy adults having a high Aβ level and car-
rying the Met allele, the rate of HV reduction was signifi-
cantly more. 

[CHUNK 13546]
A greater reduction rate in HV was observed in 
Val/Val homozygotes who were having high Aβ levels than 
with low Aβ, irrespective of their BDNF Val66Met poly-
morphism over 36 months. 

[CHUNK 13547]
In another study, BDNFMet car-
riers exhibited greater memory decline and hippocampal 
atrophy in a span of 36 months compared to BDNF Val ho-
mozygotes. 

[CHUNK 13548]
While increased memory decline and hippocam-
pal atrophy have been reported previously in adults with an 
MCI and high Aβ, Lim et al., (2014) provided a preliminary 
report and linked high Aβ and BDNF Val66Met polymor-
phism in prodromal AD suggesting them as important prog-
nostic markers of increased memory decline and hippocam-
pal atrophy [73].

Kidney/Brain (KIBRA) Protein, a Memory-Associated 
Protein 
 
KIBRA protein is expressed in various parts of the brain, 
mostly enriched in the postsynaptic density in the hippocam-
pus [74]. 

[CHUNK 13551]
It interacts with several postsynaptic proteins in-
cluding dendrin and synaptopodin and function in memory-
related processes through these interactions [75]. 

[CHUNK 13552]
Tracy et al. 


[CHUNK 13553]
(2016) identified an abnormal acetylation of K274 and K281 
on tau in AD brains, which increased memory loss and dis-
rupted synaptic plasticity by reducing the postsynaptic 
KIBRA protein [76]. 

[CHUNK 13554]
The transgenic mice capable of acety-
lating K274 and K281 exhibited memory deficits and im-
pairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). 

[CHUNK 13555]
The 
LTP deficit could be saved by increasing the polymerization

An increase

patients with dementia. 

[CHUNK 13561]
This study led to a novel mechanism 
of pathogenic tau caused a role in causing synaptic dysfunc-
tion and cognitive decline in AD. 
 


[CHUNK 13562]
Genes- APOE, BDNF, KIBRA, klotho (KL), Spondin-1 
(SPON1), CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) are 
important measures of cognitive change and the influences 
of these individual genes have been investigated and re-
corded thoroughly. 

[CHUNK 13563]
Porter et al. 

[CHUNK 13564]
(2018) emphasized on de-
termining the gene risk profiling for preclinical trials in AD 
with cognition to assess the therapeutic efficacy [77].

[CHUNK 13566]
Brain Imaging 
 
There are profound changes that occur in the brain’s 
structure and its function due to normal aging and AD. 

[CHUNK 13567]
AD 
follows an extensive cortical neuronal loss, with loss of con-
nections in brain systems. 

[CHUNK 13568]
Recent advancements in brain 
imaging have supported unique interruptions in functional 
neural networks. 

[CHUNK 13569]
Concomitantly the potential of brain imag-
ing has expanded rapidly with innovations in tools to acquire 
images and its analysis. 

[CHUNK 13570]
Now they address structural, func-
tional, and molecular aspects with imaging in AD. 

[CHUNK 13571]
Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is being used for both structural 
and functional and PET for evaluation of both amyloid and 
cerebral metabolisms. 

[CHUNK 13572]
Structural and functional MRI, fluoro-
deoxy glucose (FDG) and amyloid PET are the most com-
monly used imaging techniques. 

[CHUNK 13573]
Other MRI techniques in 
development that are also adding to the knowledge of AD 
are diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and associated tractogra-
phy technologies, arterial spin labeling measures of cerebral 
blood flow and PET tracers targeted at the cholinergic sys-
tem, microglial activation and other tracers [78]. 

[CHUNK 13574]
The PET 
imaging has utility of diagnostic decision making, confi-
dence in diagnosis and management planning for patients 
with cognitive impairment [79]. 

[CHUNK 13575]
Recent developments in 
neuroimaging studies of AD provide useful information to 
clinicians, including a new in vivo amyloid imaging. 

[CHUNK 13576]
MRI, 
single photon emission computed tomography and 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-
FDG PET) are currently available for clinical use [80]. 

[CHUNK 13577]
The 
first-in-human study by Lohith et al. 

[CHUNK 13578]
(2019) reported the 
utility of 18F-MK-6240 as an NFT imaging PET tracer in a 
small cohort of 4 cognitively normal HE (Healthy Elderly) 
subjects, 4 subjects with clinically probable AD, and 2 sub-
jects with amnestic MCI due to AD. 

[CHUNK 13579]
They found that 18F-
MK-6240 exhibits regional retention in a plausible pattern 
for NFT pathology in AD. 

[CHUNK 13580]
Importantly, in NFT depositing 
regions, signal magnitude in terms of semi quantitative 
SUVR or fully quantitative VT values were higher in 
AD/MCI subjects compared with HE subjects, with no evi-
dence of off-target binding in HE subjects [81]. 


[CHUNK 13581]

[CHUNK 13582]
Markers of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) 
 
According to the American Psychiatric Association 1987, 
dementia is an acquired cognitive impairment that interferes 
with social and occupational abilities. 

[CHUNK 13583]
Cognitive functioning 
is the hallmark of MCI, which is bad for age but not as bad 
enough to be called dementia. 

[CHUNK 13584]
A related concept, known as 
Cognitive Impairment, No Dementia (CIND) has the pres-
ence of cognitive impairment with the absence of dementia 
[82]. 

[CHUNK 13585]
Thus, a fine distinction between both (or CIND) is the 
level of the cognitive impairment itself, and thus as reflected 
in its functional responses. 

[CHUNK 13586]
MCI is always referred at an 
early stage of AD on the global deterioration scale [83] and 
to another factor comprising DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, third edition, Re-
vised) and ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 
Tenth Revision)diagnostic criteria [84], its most popular and 
cited version is the Mayo Criteria or Petersen Criteria [85] 
which is now called Amnestic MCI. 

[CHUNK 13587]
IWG or Winblad Crite-
ria also included non-amnestic impairments in the definition 
of MCI [86]. 

[CHUNK 13588]
This criterion set is the prevailing standard for 
the MCI syndrome in current times, and is reflected in the 
NIAAA work group guidelines for the diagnosis of MCI due 
to AD [87]. 

[CHUNK 13589]
It includes that the person is neither normal nor 
with dementia; there is a sign of decline in cognitive func-
tions, and daily living activities are preserved with complex 
and intricate functions either being intact or minimally im-
paired [88]. 
 


[CHUNK 13590]
Among various volumetric MRI-based techniques, me-
dial temporal volume loss is considered as an important 
biomarker for assessing the progression of AD in patients 
with pre-existing MCI of regional brain atrophy. 

[CHUNK 13591]
“Brain at-
rophy score” was derived using the linear discrimination 
analysis from healthy controls and AD patient’s data, found 
to be better for predicting one-year cognitive decline than 
atrophy in medial temporal structures alone. 

[CHUNK 13592]
This atrophy 
score considered the volume of the various parts of the brain 
using a linear discrimination analysis which best-differentiated 
AD patients from healthy controls. 

[CHUNK 13593]
Later this brain atrophy 
score was ameliorated by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) 
scores and APOE ε4 alleles number to the model [89]. 


[CHUNK 13594]
Kauppi et al. 

[CHUNK 13595]
(2018) recently improved the prediction of AD 
among MCI patients by uniting age-sensitive polygenic haz-
ard score (PHS) with structural neuroimaging relating to 
cognitive ability. 

[CHUNK 13596]
An improved assessment of AD risk among 
old patients with subjective memory complaint is said to be 
helpful in clinical practice to determine treatment plans, and 
for testing newer interventions in the disease [90]. 
 


[CHUNK 13597]
When CSF beta amyloid (CSF Aβ1-42) and tau protein 
levels were tested in MCI subjects, CSF tau was increased 
whereas levels of CSF Aβ1–42 were decreased compared to 
healthy controls with good comparable accuracy. 

[CHUNK 13598]
Aβ1–42 and 
CSF tau showed a sensitivity of 59% and 83% with a speci-
ficity of 100% and 90% respectively [91]. 
 


[CHUNK 13599]
The MCI diagnosis is usually based on the clinical judg-
ment made by experts in agreement with a group, by using 
psychometric algorithm or rating scale. 

[CHUNK 13600]
For differentiation 
purposes, dementia is diagnosed by standard measures such 
as ICD-10 [92], clinical dementia rating scale and criteria 
such as DSM-III-R [88, 93]. 

[CHUNK 13601]
Diagnostic measures and mark-
ers of MCI mostly focus on etiological subtypes and stages 
of the disease. 

[CHUNK 13602]
Few neuropsychological tests [94] and other 
measures including related autosomal dominant genes, me-
dial temporal atrophy, β amyloid and tau proteins levels in 
CSF, temporoparietal glucose metabolism, amyloid imaging, 
and their validation for clinical use are being considered as

Positive serology in HIV infection and 
positive testing for CAG repeat units on chromosome 4 in 
Huntington’s disease [95] would be a diagnostic marker for 
MCI in future [88]. 
 


[CHUNK 13607]
Begcevic et al. 

[CHUNK 13608]
(2018) evaluated 30 candidate brain-
related protein as prospective biomarkers for diagnosis of 
AD dementia and MCI due to AD [4]. 

[CHUNK 13609]
Amyloid beta precur-
sor like protein 1 (APLP1), secreted phosphoprotein 1 
(SPP1) and contactin 2 (CNTN2) showed discriminating 
potential for diagnosing cognitively impaired patients and 
MCI due to AD from controls. 

[CHUNK 13610]
APLP1 was elevated in MCI 
patients. 

[CHUNK 13611]
However, these findings are yet to be validated in a 
bigger independent cohort of MCI and AD dementia pa-
tients. 

[CHUNK 13612]
According to the revised guidelines for AD diagnosis 
in 2011, MCI symptoms and increased beta-amyloid levels 
in MCI suggest an early stage of the AD. 

[CHUNK 13613]
Recently a post-
synaptic protein named neurogranin (Ng) has been identified 
as a biomarker for MCI. 

[CHUNK 13614]
It has significant association with 
memory and execution in MCI subjects with an increased 
level in the CSF of AD and MCI patients compared to con-
trol with normal cognitive ability. 

[CHUNK 13615]
CSF Ng level can be used 
to determine and assess the effect of treatment as well as 
during the progression of AD [96].

CURRENT STRATEGIES IN THE TREATMENT 
OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE 
 
Till date, efforts are made to target and counterbalance 
the neurotransmitter disturbances aimed to relieve symptoms 
of the disease. 

[CHUNK 13618]
A major drawback for the unavailability of a 
specific treatment for the underlying pathology is that the 
emergence of AD-related pathologic changes begins quite early, 
almost a decade before the person shows the symptoms. 


[CHUNK 13619]
3.1. 

[CHUNK 13620]
FDA Approved Medicines 
 
Drugs that target cholinergic or glutamatergic neuro-
transmission are currently available treatments for AD. 


[CHUNK 13621]
These drugs only relieve the symptoms. 

[CHUNK 13622]
No drug is available 
that has a curative effect, though there are many ongoing 
clinical trials for such drugs. 

[CHUNK 13623]
These newly developed mole-
cules target the amyloid and tau proteins [97]. 

[CHUNK 13624]
Currently ap-
proved drugs that affect cholinergic transmission are three 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: donepezil, rivastigmine, and 
galantamine. 

[CHUNK 13625]
These drugs improve cognition in the patient 
and ease the social and economic burden. 

[CHUNK 13626]
These drugs are 
effective in mild to moderate AD. 

[CHUNK 13627]
To treat moderate to se-
vere form of AD, FDA approved Memantine in 2003. 

[CHUNK 13628]
It is a 
NMDA receptor antagonist and reduces the excitotoxicity 
observed in AD, caused due to excess of glutamatergic 
transmission. 

[CHUNK 13629]
Table 1 shows the latest drugs developed for 
the treatment of AD, however failed to enter the market due 
to clinical trial failure. 

[CHUNK 13630]
Each drug has a different mechanism 
of action such as BACE I inhibitors which inhibit the en-
zyme responsible for the processing of APP to Aβ, RAGE 
inhibitors which inhibit the influx of Aβ, PPAR-γ agonist 
which bring back insulin sensitivity and hence reduce Aβ 
formation or 5HT6 antagonist which modulate neurotrans-
mission and hence improve cognition. 
 


[CHUNK 13631]
Looking into the failure rate of AD drugs, researchers are 
simultaneously developing agents that provide symptomatic 
relief in AD, the list of such drugs that are in clinical trials is 
long, and some of them are mentioned in Table 2. 
 


[CHUNK 13632]
Apart from the drugs mentioned above, immunotherapy 
is being made use of to develop anti-amyloid and anti-tau 
agents, also alternative strategies targeting the misfolded tau 
proteins and neuronal regeneration are under investigation 
[98]. 

[CHUNK 13633]
It has been reported that there is a lag phase of many 
years between the pathological changes in the brain and the 
onset of symptoms. 

[CHUNK 13634]
If the therapy is initiated in this lag 
phase or when the first symptom of AD is observed, it would 
be of great benefit to the patient. 

[CHUNK 13635]
Hence, the 2013 FDA draft 
guidance encourages the inclusion of AD patients who are in 
the initial stages of the disease for clinical trials. 

[CHUNK 13636]
Another 
hurdle is diagnosis/identification of such patients for inclu-
sion in clinical trials [99, 100].

Gene Therapy in Alzheimer Disease 
 
Gene therapy interventions are aimed to tackle a disease 
at its source, mostly a faulty DNA/gene/protein, to repair it 
and allow the cells to fix the problem. 

[CHUNK 13646]
After revealing vari-
ous genes involved in Alzheimer’s pathology, it opens up 
vast avenues for gene therapy, which involves inserting new 
genetic material into living cells using viruses. 

[CHUNK 13647]
Due to the 
recent developments in gene therapy associated approaches 
in recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs), the possi-
bility for treating these diseases in human beings is foreseen. 


[CHUNK 13648]
In an effort to test the ability to degenerate neurons in AD 
towards a nervous system growth factor (NGF), Tuszynski et 
al. 

[CHUNK 13649]
(2015) subjected ten patients with early AD with NGF 
gene ex vivo or in vivo therapy [101]. 

[CHUNK 13650]
The findings indicated 
positive response of neurons showing cell hypertrophy, ax-
onal sprouting, and activation of functional markers. 

[CHUNK 13651]
Growth 
factor therapy induced sprouting by NGF, which persisted 
for 10 years after gene transfer and appeared safe. 

[CHUNK 13652]
In another 
study, scientists delivered a gene PGC1-alpha (Peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) 
using a modified virus to the brain cells of mice which re-
duced the development of Alzheimer's. 

[CHUNK 13653]
The treated mice 
showed better memory, no loss of brain cells in the hippo-
campus and had very few amyloid plaques after four months 
of injection. 

[CHUNK 13654]
Those that had not been treated had multiple 
plaques in their brain [102]. 

[CHUNK 13655]
This study was planned on the 
basis of earlier results of PGC-1α, where it exhibited a de-
crease in the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in cell culture by 
the same group. 

[CHUNK 13656]
Recently, Rafii et al. 

[CHUNK 13657]
(2018) reported the 
results of a multicentre randomized clinical trial of intracere-
bral gene delivery in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients 
[103]. 

[CHUNK 13658]
This trial demonstrated the feasibility of sham-
surgery-controlled stereotactic gene delivery studies in pa-
tients with AD. 

[CHUNK 13659]
Adeno-associated viral vector (serotype 2)-
nerve growth factor (AAV2-NGF) delivery was feasible and 
well-tolerated but without any clinical outcomes. 

[CHUNK 13660]
Thus, the 
study needs confirmation of precise gene targeting. 

[CHUNK 13661]
In June 
2018, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
in a recent breakthrough found a cure for Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. 

[CHUNK 13662]
A genetic snipping technique can be used to turn 
APOE4 gene responsible to cause amyloid beta proteins in 
the brain, into APOE3. 

[CHUNK 13663]
Those with one copy and two copies 
of the APOE4 gene have double and twelve times more 
chances of Alzheimer’s respectively. 

[CHUNK 13664]
APOE2 might protect 
and lower risk of Alzheimer's. 

[CHUNK 13665]
To overcome this issue, gene 
editing could be the answer [104].

[CHUNK 13667]
Theranostics in Alzheimer’s Disease 
 
Theranostics is the latest technology, which combines 
therapeutics and diagnostics rather than using them in isola-
tion. 

[CHUNK 13668]
Theranostics may completely change the available ther-
apy as well as diagnostics for AD. 

[CHUNK 13669]
Gold nanorods incorpo-
rated with two known Aβ inhibitors (Aβ15-20 and 
polyoxometalates) are capable of detecting, inhibiting and 
destroying the preformed Aβ aggregates by NIR (near infra-
red radiation) irradiation. 

[CHUNK 13670]
Depending on the process of Aβ 
aggregation, the absorbance of gold nanorods changes and 
hence the progression of the disease can be monitored [105]. 


[CHUNK 13671]
Dao et al. 

[CHUNK 13672]
(2017) have synthesized phenothiazine derivatives 
which work as near infra-red fluorescent probes, having a 
high affinity for the amyloid plaque and can detect it in the 
brain and retinal tissue of transgenic mice [106]. 

[CHUNK 13673]
These de-
rivatives also have the ability to prevent the aggregation of 
Aβ plaque and break already formed Aβ fibrils. 

[CHUNK 13674]
Charged 
molecules specifically (E)-4-(4-(dibutylamino) styryl)-1-(2-
hydroxyethyl) quinolin-1-ium chloride (DBA-SLOH) show 
high affinity for Aβ aggregates and display enhanced fluo-
rescence upon binding. 

[CHUNK 13675]
It effectively prevents the aggrega-
tion of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 fragments providing therapy for AD 
[107]. 

[CHUNK 13676]
A recombinant design has been used to develop a 
blood brain barrier shuttle which uses an antibody-mAb158 
that binds to Aβ fibrils. 

[CHUNK 13677]
This antibody is fused with two sin-
gle chain variable fragments of the transferrin receptor anti-
body-8D3. 

[CHUNK 13678]
8D3 is known to enhance uptake in the brain. 


[CHUNK 13679]
Due to this fusion, the shuttle selectively permeates the BBB 
and delivers mAb158 in the brain which works as Aβ immu-
notherapy and also as a radio-ligand for PET diagnosis, aid-
ing in the evaluation of the therapy simultaneously [108]. 


[CHUNK 13680]
Metal ions are known to act as a catalyst for plaque forma-
tion and invariably, there is always an excess of these ions. 


[CHUNK 13681]
Based on this observation, scientists have developed a nano-
probe containing a chelator-8-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic 
acid, which can detect copper concentration upon exposure 
to 980 nm. 

[CHUNK 13682]
Chelators capture excess copper ions in the brain 
and inhibit amyloid plaque induced apoptosis and also 
causes the structural transformation of Aβ [109]. 

[CHUNK 13683]
Iron oxide 
magnetic nanoparticles incorporated with Congo red/Rutin 
have been developed which can not only detect amyloid

trolled release of drugs and prevent oxidative damage [110]. 


[CHUNK 13690]
Thus, the field of theranostics which uses a single chemical 
entity for diagnosis and treatment of AD may soon have ap-
plications in personalized medicine. 
 


[CHUNK 13691]
Theranostics also involves Quantum dots (QDs), which 
are nanoparticles with bright fluorescence. 

[CHUNK 13692]
This is due to 
their unique optical and electronic properties. 

[CHUNK 13693]
QDs have been 
widely used in imaging and diagnostics. 

[CHUNK 13694]
This is because 
emission from different QDs can be estimated simultane-
ously in a single assay using one wavelength. 

[CHUNK 13695]
Recently there 
has been a lot of interest in developing theranostics applica-
tion of QDs where simultaneous imaging, diagnosis and 
therapy is possible [111]. 
 


[CHUNK 13696]
Xiao et al. 

[CHUNK 13697]
(2016) used graphene quantum dots (GQDs) 
coated with glycine-proline-glutamate in APP/PS1 trans-
genic mice. 

[CHUNK 13698]
The aggregation of amyloid plaque along with 
the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines was reduced 
whereas the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines increased, 
thus demonstrating strong potential as a therapy in AD [112]. 


[CHUNK 13699]
Wavelengths ranging from 632.8 to 400 nm like low level 
laser, can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in vari-
ous disease conditions. 

[CHUNK 13700]
However, this therapy is not useful 
since the amount of light actually penetrating the brain is 
very minute. 

[CHUNK 13701]
With the use of technology named “Biolumi-
nescence Resonance Energy Transfer to Quantum Dots” 
(BRET-Qdots), this problem can be overcome. 

[CHUNK 13702]
These CdSe 
or CdTe quantum dots act as a source of near infra-red radia-
tions and reduce the amyloid plaque induced inflammation 
and oxidative stress in animal models. 

[CHUNK 13703]
This low-level laser 
therapy (LLLT) can be further exploited to treat other dis-
eases that involve inflammation and oxidative stress pa-
thologies [113]. 
 


[CHUNK 13704]
Mars et al. 

[CHUNK 13705]
(2018) described a sensitive method based on 
dual electrochemical and fluorescence detection of APOE4 
DNA, responsible of Alzheimer and coronary artery diseases 
[114]. 

[CHUNK 13706]
Curcumin was used for its dual-sensing transducer 
response due to its highly sensitive fluorescence properties. 


[CHUNK 13707]
Graphene quantum dots were employed to enhance the elec-
trochemical response. 

[CHUNK 13708]
The analytical response showed a sen-
sitive decrease in the presence of different APO e4 DNA 
target, which was due to the blocked photo-electron transfer 
activity due to formation of DNA complex. 

[CHUNK 13709]
The curcumin-
GQDs system exhibited a high selectivity and efficacy for 
which it was also investigated in the clinical fluid. 

[CHUNK 13710]
The re-
sults showed relative standard deviation c.a. 

[CHUNK 13711]
4.7% toward

[CHUNK 13712]
Incorporation of QDs 
into microarrays is a relatively new venture, where current 
scanners have limitations in obtaining fluorescent signals 
under appropriate excitation levels for red and green lasers. 


[CHUNK 13713]
Morales-Narvaez et al. 

[CHUNK 13714]
(2012) studied the biosensing ability 
of QDs (QD655) and a fluorescent dye (A647) recruited in 
the sandwich ELISA as reporters in microarray format and 
compared it with a conventional ELISA by using ApoE as 
model analyte [115]. 

[CHUNK 13715]
A minimal volume of human serum 
was sufficient for assay with high sensitivity and good preci-
sion. 

[CHUNK 13716]
This idea is proposed for the detection of ApoE multi-
ple isoforms and other AD biomarkers. 

[CHUNK 13717]
In another study 
Medina-Sanchez et al. 

[CHUNK 13718]
(2013) used cadmium-selenide/zinc-
sulfide QDs as labelling agents for assaying and detecting 
ApoE. 

[CHUNK 13719]
They used them within a magnetic zone with mag-
netic beads for sample purification and concentration [116]. 


[CHUNK 13720]
With such requirements, the development of an integrated, 
miniaturized portable and affordable systems is possible.

Immunotherapy for Alzheimer 
 
Various mechanisms have been hypothesized for Aβ im-
munotherapy. 

[CHUNK 13723]
The soluble equilibrium mechanism includes 
antibodies neutralising and solubilising the Aβ plaque both 
centrally and peripherally. 

[CHUNK 13724]
Phagocytosis mechanism is based 
on opsonisation of Aβ plaque which stimulates microglia 
associated phagocytosis. 

[CHUNK 13725]
Antibodies also bind to Amyloid 
seed in the initial stages and can prevent its propagation 
[117]. 

[CHUNK 13726]
There are several other mechanisms like direct method 
(in which Aβ plaque are unbundled) and peripheral sink 
mechanism (removal of Aβ from the brain to plasma) [118]. 
 


[CHUNK 13727]
According to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's, Amy-
loid β plaques are the primary target for immunotherapy. 


[CHUNK 13728]
Various immunotherapy strategies are under investigation 
for Alzheimer's and which primarily include active immuni-
sation and passive immunisation. 

[CHUNK 13729]
Active immunization with 
Aβ-42 can stimulate B-cells, T-cells and microglia for im-
mune response. 

[CHUNK 13730]
Active immunization with Aβ fragments 
which are attached to carrier protein resembling helper T-cell 
epitopes is another approach that stimulates T-cells which 
releases signaling cytokines to activate antibodies releasing 
B-cells. 

[CHUNK 13731]
Other immunotherapy includes passive administra-
tion of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) [119]. 

[CHUNK 13732]
There are vari-
ous monoclonal antibodies that are tested which includes 
bapineuzumab, solanezumab, gantenerumab, crenezumab 
and ponezumab out of which some are in phase 3 clinical 
trials. 

[CHUNK 13733]
But majority of these drugs have severe side effects 
like ARIA (Amyloid related imaging abnormalities), which 
are associated with vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) or indicate 
micro haemorrhage and hemosiderosis (ARIA-H) [120]. 
 


[CHUNK 13734]
Various engineered antibodies or second-generation anti-
bodies are in the development phase. 

[CHUNK 13735]
It includes BAN2401 
(that selectively binds to large soluble Aβ protoﬁbrils), 
SAR255952 (which primarily targets soluble protoﬁbrillar 
and ﬁbrillar species of Aβ), Aducanumab (which binds to the 
N-terminus of Aβ3-6), etc. 

[CHUNK 13736]
These antibodies are mainly en-
gineered and have low binding activity at Fcγ regions which 
are mainly involved in side effects of first line monoclonal 
antibodies [121]. 

[CHUNK 13737]
Therapeutics based on active and passive 
mechanisms are compiled in Table 3.

Peptidomimetics 
 
Peptidomimetics are analogues of natural proteins that 
interact with biological targets to exhibit equivalent or supe-
rior biological effect [122]. 

[CHUNK 13740]
These peptide inhibitors can be 
derived from Aβ sequence. 

[CHUNK 13741]
They could also target phos-
phorylated tau protein as well as Human β-Secretase [123]. 


[CHUNK 13742]
The majority of these peptides can further be divided into 
peptide containing natural or modified amino acid. 
 


[CHUNK 13743]
In case of tau and Aβ aggregates the major recognition, 
sites are of the central hydrophobic core. 

[CHUNK 13744]
For tau it is 
VQIVYK or VQIINK and for Aβ it is KLVFF.

The pepti-
domimetics reacts or bind to these regions and prevents fur-

solve the pre formed aggregates. 

[CHUNK 13751]
As proven inhibiting only 
aggregation cannot prevent AD therefore, multifunctional 
peptidomimetics were developed, which targeted other fac-
tors involved in AD. 

[CHUNK 13752]
For example, Thy-KSrVSrFSr(P5) mul-
tifunctional peptidomimetic (based on KLVFF recognition 
site) is a potent inhibitor of Aβ. 

[CHUNK 13753]
It stimulates the degradation 
of Aβ by activating autophagy mechanism in a yeast model. 


[CHUNK 13754]
Another example includes multifunctional peptidomimetic 
GHKSrVSrFSr(P6), which chelates Cu2 released from Aβ42-
Cu2 and protects plasmid DNA and other cells from ROS 
and metal induced toxicity [122]. 
 


[CHUNK 13755]
There are various peptidomimetics designed against Aβ 
aggregates. 

[CHUNK 13756]
They could further be subdivided to peptide tar-
geting central hydrophobic core (KLVFFA) or c-terminus. 


[CHUNK 13757]
Peptidomimetics based on central hydrophobic core contain-
ing natural amino acid included Aβ (15-22), Aβ (16-23), Aβ 
(17-24), iAβ11 (RDLPFFPVRID), iAβ5 (LPFFD), iAβ5p 
(Ac-LPFFD-amide), etc. 

[CHUNK 13758]
and those containing modified 
amino acid included PPI-368 [cholyl-(LVFFA) -OH], PPI-
433 [cholyl-(lvﬀa) -OH], PPI457 [cholyl-(lvﬀa)-NH2], NH2-
K(Me-L) V (Me-F) F(Me-A) ECONH2, pgklvya, kklvﬀarrrra, 
kklvﬀa etc. 

[CHUNK 13759]
Peptide inhibitor that target C terminal and con-
tained natural amino acid included Gly-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-
NH2, Arg-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-NH2, Aβ (31-42), Aβ(39-42), 
Aβ(20-29), tachykinins, etc. 

[CHUNK 13760]
and those with modified amino 
acid included Pr-IIGLa (propionyl-Ile-Ile-Gly-Leu amide), 
RIIGLa, Aβ(25-35) with Gly33 N-methylated and Leu34  
N-methylated, N-methylated hexapeptides (28-31) etc.

[CHUNK 13763]
Metal Chelators 
 
Interaction of metals with Aβ leads to the generation of 
ROS as well as abnormal metal ion homeostasis which is 
linked to the pathogenesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 13764]
Metal chelators are agents 
that break the Aβ-metal complex and restore metal ion ho-
meostasis and hence reduce neuro toxicity. 

[CHUNK 13765]
Chelators usually 
have low molecular weight, small molecular size and neutral 
or low charge to penetrate blood brain barrier. 

[CHUNK 13766]
Chelators do 
not exhibit strong specific activity towards metal ions as it 
can deplete its level and lead to abnormal metal ion concen-
tration [125]. 
 


[CHUNK 13767]
In AD the level of metal ions in the brain mainly copper, 
iron, zinc increases almost 3 times the normal. 

[CHUNK 13768]
As a result, 
these were the main metals targeted for chelation. 

[CHUNK 13769]
Deferox-
amine (DFO) and Deferiprone are main metal chelators for 
iron. 

[CHUNK 13770]
They treat memory impairment due to iron and also 
prevent ROS production as well as metal induced toxicity. 


[CHUNK 13771]
There are various analogues which target copper ions. 

[CHUNK 13772]
They 
include pyrrolidine dithiocarbonate (PDTC), pyridine deriva-
tives, reduced Schiff base derivatives, Bis(hydrazide), 
bis(thiosemicarbazones) (BTSC), peptides and multifunc-
tional ligands [126].

Clioquinol from class 8-hydroxyquinoline has shown 
better results in treating neurodegenerative disease. 

[CHUNK 13796]
It is a bi-
dentate ligand which has 2:1 activity against copper and zinc 
ions. 

[CHUNK 13797]
It is known to transfer metal ions from extracellular 
environment to intra cellular environment of the cell to 
maintain metal ion balance and also dissolves Ab-
Cu2+/Zn2+aggregates [125, 126]. 
 


[CHUNK 13798]
Another approach included designing of hybrid multi-
functional modulators (HMMs). 

[CHUNK 13799]
HMMs inhibit aggregation 
of Aβ associated with metal ions and prevent mitochondrial 
damage. 

[CHUNK 13800]
Among them, TGR86 gave best results for inhibiting 
Aβ by sequestering it from copper ions followed by TGR88, 
TGR87 and Clq. 

[CHUNK 13801]
They mainly bind to 20FAEDVGSNKG29 of 
Aβ-42 isoforms. 

[CHUNK 13802]
TGR86forms additional hydrogen bonds 
with Asn27, Lys28 and Ser26 region of Aβ due to which it 
showed maximum activity. 

[CHUNK 13803]
TGR86 also increases cell viability 
[122]. 

[CHUNK 13804]
As ROS is one of the major factor associated with AD 
which can cause neurotoxicity, metal chelators are the best 
line of therapy which can be used to prevent it in the future.

[CHUNK 13806]
Probiotics, Prebiotics and Exercise 
 
Alteration in gut microbiota can lead to AD as gut mi-
crobes are associated with the modulation of neurotransmit-
ter and immune response by its interaction with the brain 
through brain-gut metabolic axis. 

[CHUNK 13807]
Various studies are con-
ducted on animals as well as humans to identify the effects 
of prebiotics and probiotics on AD. 

[CHUNK 13808]
Probiotics facilitate the 
growth of gut microbes with the help of prebiotics which 
provide a suitable environment and nutrients for its growth. 


[CHUNK 13809]
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the two main classes 
of gut microbes which are widely studied. 

[CHUNK 13810]
Probiotics like 
VSL#3 containing 8-gram positive bacteria showed an in-
crease in Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes in animal models 
whereas supplementation with Bifidobacterium breve strain 
A1 reduces memory impairment, neuronal inflammation and 
immune responses in animal models [127]. 

[CHUNK 13811]
Another study 
for animal model involved treatment with FRAMELIN 
which consist of probiotics like Lactobacillus acidophilus 
lysates, Bifidobacterium longum, omega 3 fatty acids, vita-
mins (A, D, B1, B3, B6, B9, B12) and exercise which in-
cluded running on treadmill for a particular period of time. 


[CHUNK 13812]
The results were evaluated with the help of Morris Water 
Maze Test, open ﬁeld test, microbiome investigation and 
spontaneous alteration tests. 

[CHUNK 13813]
It was concluded that regular 
physical exercise and probiotic supplementation prevent fur-
ther progression of AD and alleviates its symptoms [128]. 
 


[CHUNK 13814]
Study on human included intake of probiotics which be-
longed to genera Lactobacillus (L. casei, L. acidophilus, L. 
plantarum, L. salivarius, L. paracasei) and Bifidobacterium 
(Bifidobacterium lactis and Bifidobacterium bifidum) along 
with Lactococcus lacti. 

[CHUNK 13815]
Vitamin D was given additionally. 


[CHUNK 13816]
Results were produced which showed activation of immune 
system. 

[CHUNK 13817]
The probiotic supplements should be mild and not 
very intensive as it can lead to disruption of gut microbiota 
activating the immune system and leading to neuroinflam-
mation [129].

Voice as a Biomarker Using Artificial Intelligence 
 
In addition to dementia Alzheimer's is also known to 
cause loss of language skills which leads to difficulty in 
speaking and impair communication with the environment. 


[CHUNK 13830]
The clinical manifestations mainly include anomia and aphasia. 
 


[CHUNK 13831]
At different stages of AD, patients experience different 
communication problems: 
1. 

[CHUNK 13832]
Early stage (ES) - The patient is unable to detect the 
right word in the speech or in the sentence frame. 


[CHUNK 13833]
2. 

[CHUNK 13834]
Intermediate stage (IS) - They impoverish their vo-
cabulary and language of daily use. 


[CHUNK 13835]
3. 

[CHUNK 13836]
Advanced stage (AS) - They speak very less and 
their response is very limited. 
 


[CHUNK 13837]
Therefore, speech or voice analysis along with analysis 
of emotional temperature of patients suffering from AD is 
very important and can be used as a diagnostic tool for de-
tecting Alzheimer's in its preliminary stage [130]. 
 


[CHUNK 13838]
Various approaches have been made to demonstrate the 
potential of speech in detecting Alzheimer's or dementia. 
 


[CHUNK 13839]
Jarrold et al. 

[CHUNK 13840]
(2014) differentiated between different 
types of dementia. 

[CHUNK 13841]
Speech data of 9 controls, 9 patients suf-
fering from AD and 30 patients suffering from fronto-
temporal lobar degeneration (13 with semantic dementia, 9 
with fronto-temporal dementia and 8 with progressive non-
fluent aphasia) from NIH funded studies performed at UCSF 
Memory and Aging Centre were collected. 

[CHUNK 13842]
Speech samples 
were collected from semi-structured interviews in which the 
patients were asked to describe a picture. 

[CHUNK 13843]
The recording of 
patient’s speech was then used as input to a machine learning 
algorithm. 

[CHUNK 13844]
Using multi-layer perceptron algorithm score of 
88% was achieved [131]. 
 


[CHUNK 13845]
Orimaye et al. 

[CHUNK 13846]
(2014) also performed a diagnostic 
method to identify patients suffering from Alzheimer. 

[CHUNK 13847]
De-
mentia Bank dataset was used to extract the audio data. 

[CHUNK 13848]
The 
dataset consisted of audio recordings of interviews of people 
suffering from Alzheimer and dementia. 

[CHUNK 13849]
The interview was 
taken in the English language on the basis of description of 
cookie theft picture. 

[CHUNK 13850]
The study included binary diagnosis of 
Dementia and control groups. 

[CHUNK 13851]
The dementia group included 
314 patients (249 diagnosed with probable AD, 21 suffering 
from possible AD, 5 with VD (Vascular dementia), 3 with 
problems related to memory, 43 with Mild cognitive im-
pairment and 4 with undiscovered form of dementia) and 
242 healthy people were included in the control group. 

[CHUNK 13852]
Nine 
syntactic features (coordinated sentences, subordinated sen-
tences, reduced sentences, number of predicates, the average 
number of predicates, dependency distance, number of de-
pendencies, average dependencies per sentence and produc-
tion rules) and eleven lexical features (utterances, Mean 
Length of Utterances, function words, unique words, word 
count, character length, total sentences, repetitions, revi-
sions, lexical bigrams and morphemes) were thoroughly ana-
lysed. 

[CHUNK 13853]
Four different machine learning classification algo-
rithms were explored. 

[CHUNK 13854]
74% accuracy was achieved by using 
SVM (Support vector machine) classifier with 10% cross 
validation [132]. 

[CHUNK 13855]
Lopez-de-Ipiña et al. 

[CHUNK 13856]
(2015) performed a 
diagnosis AD on the basis of emotional temperature and 
spontaneous speech analysis. 

[CHUNK 13857]
Multicultural and multilingual 
(Chinese, English, French, Catalan, Spanish, Basque, Portu-
guese and Arabian) database of video recording was created. 


[CHUNK 13858]
The study included 20 healthy and 20 patients suffering from 
AD. 

[CHUNK 13859]
Then the data was segmented in 600 segments which 
were analysed thoroughly. 

[CHUNK 13860]
It was done to identify the impor-
tance of emotions encapsulated in spontaneous speech. 

[CHUNK 13861]
The 
test showed positive as well as promising results in differen-
tiating different stages of AD. 

[CHUNK 13862]
It concluded that there is a 
decrease in fluency in speech of people suffering from AD 
[130]. 

[CHUNK 13863]
Konig et al. 

[CHUNK 13864]
(2015) using four short vocal tasks per-
formed an experiment. 

[CHUNK 13865]
The participants were categorized 
into 3 different groups i.e. 

[CHUNK 13866]
healthy control (HC), people suf-
fering from Alzheimer (AD) and people suffering from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). 

[CHUNK 13867]
The method involved pre-

Fraser et al. 

[CHUNK 13870]
(2016) stud-
ied the importance of linguistic features in detecting Alz-
heimer disease. 

[CHUNK 13871]
The data was extracted from the dementia 
bank data set. 

[CHUNK 13872]
The study consisted of two groups i.e. 

[CHUNK 13873]
Demen-
tia group and the control group. 

[CHUNK 13874]
The dementia group in-
cluded participants diagnosed with probable AD or possible 
AD which resulted in 240 speech samples from 167 partici-
pants. 

[CHUNK 13875]
The Control group included 97 participants with 233 
speech samples. 

[CHUNK 13876]
The method extracted and analysed 370 
features which included part-of-speech, syntactic complex-
ity, grammatical constituents, psycholinguistics, vocabulary 
richness, information content and repetitiveness, acoustics. 


[CHUNK 13877]
Two machine learning classification algorithms were applied 
to analyse the data. 

[CHUNK 13878]
Accuracy of 92% was obtained in distin-
guishing people suffering from AD and healthy control 
group using top 25 ranked features [134].

FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN PREDICTION OF 
ALZHEIMER’S 
DISEASE 
WITH 
ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE 
 
The field of bioscience has undergone an exponential 
expansion with recent advances in the field of genomics, 
proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metagenomics 
and metabolomics etc. 

[CHUNK 13900]
These developments in the field have 
offered huge amount of unprocessed data, which called for 
the unprecented rise of Artificial intelligence (AI) to use and 
process abundant imaging data with computer-controlled 
robot and information technology. 

[CHUNK 13901]
AI is able to integrate the 
accumulated data and to generate valuable predictions for 
therapeutic applications. 

[CHUNK 13902]
As it’s impossible to conclude one 
particular gene for a disease, the recent failure of a BACE1 
inhibitor for Alzheimer’s has drawn attention towards the 
distinctive role of multiple genes in pertinent biological 
pathways and the importance of data reproducibility to ad-
dress serious issues in this field. 

[CHUNK 13903]
AI has capacity to process a 
massive amount of whole-genome data to recognize the most 
relevant pathways, and increase the probability to find the 
best target for the therapy. 

[CHUNK 13904]
These studies have identified non-
coding regions like THAP9-AS1 as the topmost targets for 
AD. 

[CHUNK 13905]
These targets could potentially answer more fundamen-
tal questions about memories in the future [136]. 

[CHUNK 13906]
The advan-
tage of AI is the algorithm can be applied to many disparate 
and unassociated data sets. 

[CHUNK 13907]
An early detection has become a 
prerequisite for the betterment of AD. 

[CHUNK 13908]
By the time the clini-
cal symptoms become evident, the neurons are already dead 
and the condition is impossible to reverse. 
 


[CHUNK 13909]
McGill University’s department of psychiatry is using 
public data from about 800 individuals from normal control, 
Alzheimer’s patients or the ones suffering from mild cogni-
tive impairment. 

[CHUNK 13910]
AI interface is using their MRI scans, a 
highly associated genetic marker in AD, and a simple cogni-
tion activity profile to identify patients with decline signs 
despite the diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 13911]
Efforts are being made to test if the 
tool can be used advanced for clinical set-up, as data can 
remain useful even after many years since it is first collected 
for prediction of neurodegeneration over time in the indi-
viduals. 

[CHUNK 13912]
With the advent of AI, doctors are hopeful to get 
certainty to judge the risk for decline in elderly or middle-
aged subjects [137]. 
 


[CHUNK 13913]
In a recent advancement with the tool, Ding et al. 

[CHUNK 13914]
(2018) 
used deep learning algorithm with fluorine, 18F-FDG PET 
scan of the brain for early prediction of AD. 

[CHUNK 13915]
They attained 
82% specificity with 100% sensitivity, at an average of 75.8 
months ahead of the final diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 13916]
They used data from 
1,002 patients from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) and 40 patients for the retrospective inde-
pendent test set between 2005 and 2017. 

[CHUNK 13917]
The deep learning 
algorithm developed itself learning from 90% of the dataset 
and then tested it on the remaining 10% of the dataset. 


[CHUNK 13918]
Through deep learning, the algorithm trained itself to read 
metabolic patterns that correlated to Alzheimer’s and was 
able to predict every single case of AD. 

[CHUNK 13919]
As the variations in 
the glucose uptake pattern in the brain are delicate and scat-
tered, it’s important to trap the metabolic changes to repre-
sent a broader yet subtle process [138]. 

[CHUNK 13920]
Such studies are sug-
gested to be validated in a larger multi-institutional group. 


[CHUNK 13921]
Future should focus on training the deep learning algorithm 
to search for specific patterns might be analogous to the 
marker’s accumulation in the brain specific to AD [139]. 

[CHUNK 13922]
But 
looking into this vast information without AI, is a cumber-
some process; AI can help us rely on machine learning tools, 
where a computer software is made smart enough to read and 
process as fine as glucose metabolism patterns and relate it 
to complex AD symptoms. 
 


[CHUNK 13923]
Other approaches included building a Neuroimaging 
identification system with the help of Git Bash programming 
aid software, Inception V3 image sorter and Unix com-
mands. 

[CHUNK 13924]
MRI of 2542 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer and 
500 MRI of healthy patients from ADNI (Alzheimer disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative) were used. 

[CHUNK 13925]
Hippocampal atrophy 
and volumetric reduction of entorhinal cortex were mainly 
analysed by the system to differentiate AD and healthy pa-
tients. 

[CHUNK 13926]
To perform this analysis, the photos of the brain scan 
were uploaded and then segregated into pixels. 

[CHUNK 13927]
The colours 
of the pixel were examined and bottlenecks, text files were 
created which were reviewed 3 million times. 

[CHUNK 13928]
Then the re-
sults were generated in descending order of possibilities dif-
ferentiating between AD and healthy with good accuracy 
[140]. 
 


[CHUNK 13929]
Another approach included Novel Machine Learning 
(MC) which identify subject with pre-MCI (Mild cognitive 
impairment) and MCI and their conversion to AD following 
3 years. 

[CHUNK 13930]
Support Vector Machine was used as its algorithm 
which assigned 16 features to a category to multiply the dif-
ferences between the MCI and AD diagnosed patients. 

[CHUNK 13931]
First 
the program was trained to differentiate between AD-control 
and it gave excellent results (AUC of 0.996). 

[CHUNK 13932]
After that the 
algorithm was used to predict MCI conversion to AD which 
showed slight drop in its performance (AUC of 0.821) [141]. 
 


[CHUNK 13933]
There are several AI systems that help the AD patients to 
improve their life quality and also assist them in life Daily 
Activities (LDA). 

[CHUNK 13934]
AICS (Alzheimer’s Intelligence care sys-
tem) is a highly personalized system which creates treatment 
regimen for the patient on the basis of MMSE (Mini-Mental 
State Examination) stages as enlisted in Table 4. 

[CHUNK 13935]
MMSE is a 
widely used test to measure and screen cognitive ability. 

[CHUNK 13936]
The 
treatment regimen is created on the basis of MMSE results 
and the approval of doctors and care givers. 

[CHUNK 13937]
The system 
mainly includes reminder system, schema therapy to review 
specific life events and alarm system for health, drug and 
daily living. 

[CHUNK 13938]
After all this, the system also receives feedback 
and, on its basis, modifies the regimen [142]. 
 


[CHUNK 13939]
Various mobile-based applications like RxMind me, 
Mymeds, Alzheimer’s caregiver buddy, Alzheimer’s daily 
companion are designed as a virtual caregiver to remind the 
patient regarding LDA.

Khan et al. 
 


[CHUNK 13943]
Albright (2019) predicted the progression of Alzheimers 
using “All-Pairs” technique with data of 1737 patients, com-
paring possible pairs of temporal data points. 

[CHUNK 13944]
When a sepa-
rate data set (110 patients) was used for machine learning 
models, a neural network model showed good result (mAUC 
= 0.866) at predicting the progression of Alzheimer in nor-
mal and mild cognitive impairment diagnosed patients [143]. 


[CHUNK 13945]
AD and other causes of cognitive impairment were also dif-
ferentiated with machine learning and neuropsychological 
testing. 

[CHUNK 13946]
With samples of 158 patients divided on the basis of 
Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) into early and a 
late stage group (labelled as non-AD and AD), around 82% 
patients were clearly differentiated as AD and non-AD in 
total group and the accuracy increased to 89% [144]. 

[CHUNK 13947]
Farooq 
et al. 

[CHUNK 13948]
(2017) used deep learning-based framework to analyse 
MRI scans and classified them into normal cognitive (NC), 
initial stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), later stage 
of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 


[CHUNK 13949]
Around 98.88% accuracy was obtained by this method in 
diagnosing AD [145]. 

[CHUNK 13950]
Most of the above studies used artifi-
cial neural-networks (also known as deep learning), highly 
successful due to its virtual structure resembling the biologi-
cal neural network. 

[CHUNK 13951]
Reproducibility of results and ease of 
rewriting them are some of the advantages associated with 
artificial intelligence. 

[CHUNK 13952]
Further artificial intelligence and arti-
ficial neural network can be used to analyse petabyte of data 
from each neuron and model other biological factors like 
glial cells, hormones and even microbiome which affect the 
functioning of neuron [146]. 


[CHUNK 13953]
CONCLUSION 
 
Dementia is a syndrome characterized by functional and 
cognitive decline. 

[CHUNK 13954]
Various hypotheses, however unable to 
explain the complete picture, have been put forth for the 
pathogenesis of AD. 

[CHUNK 13955]
The cause in many cases remains un-
traceable, hence no treatment options can halt or reverse dis-
ease progression, although some may temporarily ameliorate 
symptoms. 

[CHUNK 13956]
Gene therapy and Quantum dots are the recent 
additions as therapeutic agents for AD, however they are yet 
to be clinically approved. 

[CHUNK 13957]
Early diagnosis is of utmost impor-
tance since it not only benefits the patient by providing 
prompt treatment but also aids in the inclusion of patients in 
the initial stages of the disease for the conduct of clinical 
trials of promising drug candidates. 

[CHUNK 13958]
Detection of AD with 
cerebrospinal fluid markers, blood test for inflammatory 
biomarkers, amyloid imaging with concurrent markers, 
volumetric MRI, are promising diagnostic indicators. 

[CHUNK 13959]
As 
early diagnosis allows an access to treatment options and 
cost-effective caregiving, we have emphasized on use of 
immunotherapy, theranostics, and artificial intelligence in 
diagnosis with biomarkers in AD patients. 

[CHUNK 13960]
Most of the im-
munotherapeutics is in Phase 3 clinical trials. 

[CHUNK 13961]
Approaches 
such as peptidomimetics, speech as an indicator, metal ion 
chelators, etc. 

[CHUNK 13962]
are still under investigation and research thus 
not widely used.

Background:
Alzheimer’s
disease
(AD)
is
a
chronic,
progressive
neurodegenerative
disorder
characterized
by
cognitive
decline,
memory
loss, and impaired reasoning. 

[CHUNK 14673]
It is the leading cause of dementia in older
adults, marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and
neuroﬁbrillary tangles. 

[CHUNK 14674]
These pathological changes lead to widespread neuronal
damage, signiﬁcantly impacting daily functioning and quality of life.


[CHUNK 14675]
Objective:
This comprehensive review aims to explore various aspects of
Alzheimer’s disease, including its epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation,
diagnostic advancements, management strategies, caregiving challenges, and
emerging therapeutic interventions.


[CHUNK 14676]
Methods:
A systematic literature review was conducted across multiple
electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and
Scopus, from their inception to May 2024. 

[CHUNK 14677]
The search strategy incorporated
a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms
such as “Alzheimer’s disease,” “epidemiology,” “risk factors,” “symptoms,”
“diagnosis,” “management,” “caregiving,” “treatment,” and “novel therapies.”
Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used to reﬁne the search, ensuring
a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature on Alzheimer’s disease.

[CHUNK 14680]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
Results: AD is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by genetic predispositions, such as the
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, along with modiﬁable environmental factors
like diet, physical activity, and cognitive engagement. 

[CHUNK 14681]
Diagnostic approaches
have evolved with advances in neuroimaging techniques (MRI, PET), and
biomarker analysis, allowing for earlier detection and intervention. 

[CHUNK 14682]
The National
Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association have updated diagnostic
criteria to include biomarker data, enhancing early diagnosis.


[CHUNK 14683]
Conclusion:
The management of AD includes pharmacological treatments,
such as cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists, which
provide symptomatic relief but do not slow disease progression. 

[CHUNK 14684]
Emerging
therapies, including amyloid-beta and tau-targeting treatments, gene therapy,
and immunotherapy, oﬀer potential for disease modiﬁcation. 

[CHUNK 14685]
The critical role
of caregivers is underscored, as they face considerable emotional, physical, and
ﬁnancial burdens. 

[CHUNK 14686]
Support programs, communication strategies, and educational
interventions are essential for improving caregiving outcomes. 

[CHUNK 14687]
While signiﬁcant
advancements have been made in understanding and managing AD, ongoing
research is necessary to identify new therapeutic targets and enhance diagnostic
and treatment strategies. 

[CHUNK 14688]
A holistic approach, integrating clinical, genetic, and
environmental factors, is essential for addressing the multifaceted challenges of
Alzheimer’s disease and improving outcomes for both patients and caregivers.

1 Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disorder that causes memory loss and other cognitive impairments,
such as deterioration in language, learning, memory, visual-spatial
abilities, reasoning, and behavior (1). 

[CHUNK 14690]
The decline in cognitive
abilities can become severe enough to interfere with daily activities.


[CHUNK 14691]
AD is the most prevalent form of dementia, contributing to at
least two-thirds of dementia cases among individuals aged 65 and
older (2, 3). 

[CHUNK 14692]
The pathological hallmarks of AD are neuroﬁbrillary
tangles (NFTs), which are formed by hyperphosphorylated tau
protein within neurons, and extracellular plaques composed of
accumulated β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide (3, 4).


[CHUNK 14693]
In 1906, Alois Alzheimer, a German doctor, published his now-
famous case study. 

[CHUNK 14694]
He carefully detailed the symptoms of a 51-year-
old woman named Auguste Deter, who was in his care at the state
asylum in Frankfurt, Germany (5). 

[CHUNK 14695]
The neuropathologic analysis
of Alzheimer’s patients revealed widespread brain degeneration
and speciﬁc changes in cortical cellular bundles. 

[CHUNK 14696]
He presented
his research titled “On the peculiar disease process of the
cerebral cortex” (6). 

[CHUNK 14697]
Since then, progress has been made in our
understanding of the disease that bears his name, along with its
neuropsychological eﬀects (7). 

[CHUNK 14698]

Cain Wong identiﬁed amyloid protein as the primary constituent
of extracellular plaques (8). 

[CHUNK 14701]
In 1986, researchers discovered that
the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein results in the
neuroﬁbrillary tangles characteristic of Alzheimer’s. 

[CHUNK 14702]
Tau protein
is a type of protein that maintains microtubules and is released
during neurodegeneration (9, 10).

In 1993, Tacrine (Cognex)
became the ﬁrst drug authorized by the FDA to address the
cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s, such as thinking and memory
(11). 

[CHUNK 14704]
It is essential to note that the clinical diagnostic criteria
for AD were updated in 1984, 2011, 2018, and 2024 to reﬂect
the growing availability of biomarkers and improved ability to
identify preclinical disease episodes (12–15). 

[CHUNK 14705]
In the most recent
update in 2024, AD as described as beginning as an asymptomatic
biological process with AD neuropathologic changes (ADNPC),
progressing to clinical symptoms as the neuropathologic burden
increases. 

[CHUNK 14706]
Early-changing Core 1 biomarkers, such as amyloid PET,
cerebrospinal ﬂuid, and plasma biomarkers, reﬂect ADNPC and
are suﬃcient for diagnosis and clinical decision-making. 

[CHUNK 14707]
Later-
changing Core 2 biomarkers provide prognostic insights and
increase conﬁdence that AD is contributing to symptoms, with an
integrated staging scheme accounting for factors like copathologies
and cognitive reserve (16).


[CHUNK 14708]
In the coming decades, Alzheimer’s care will likely remain
a signiﬁcant public health concern (17). 

[CHUNK 14709]
Due to this ongoing
and future concern, increasing knowledge and research about AD
could be eﬀective through various approaches, such as identifying
and managing risk factors, and updating methods for early
diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 

[CHUNK 14710]
Gaining further insight into
the aging process and alterations in brain function, along with
evaluating strategies to halt disease progression, could lead to
improved approaches to this challenging disease.

In this study,
we aim to present a comprehensive review of AD, examining
its epidemiology, genetics, underlying environmental factors,
symptoms, various diagnostic techniques, treatment, challenges,
and concerns.

It should be noted that mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
caused by AD can progress to AD dementia, with 40–75% of MCI

[CHUNK 14768]
4 Genetics of Alzheimer’s disease
Despite the overall sporadic nature of the disease, many
studies have shown that Genetic mutations and gene variance have
been linked to an increased risk of acquiring AD. 

[CHUNK 14769]
Most cases
of Alzheimer’s do not have a single genetic cause, and this gene
variance can aﬀect the probability of developing the disease (19).


[CHUNK 14770]
Furthermore, AD is complex and inﬂuenced by many factors,
including lifestyle and environmental variables (20). 

[CHUNK 14771]
Aging is the
most signiﬁcant biological risk factor for acquiring AD later in
life. 

[CHUNK 14772]
Accordingly, up to 82% of individuals are diagnosed above
the age of 65 known as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD)
(21). 

[CHUNK 14773]
A genetic etiology of up to 100% is found in 10% of AD
patients who are diagnosed before reaching the age of 65, known
as early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) (21, 22). 

[CHUNK 14774]
Between 35
and 60% of EOAD individuals have ﬁrst-degree relatives who have
dementia (23, 24). 

[CHUNK 14775]
Signiﬁcant mutations that lead to EOAD are
genes coding the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome
21q, presenilin 1 on 14q, and presenilin 2 on 1q (25).


[CHUNK 14776]
4.1 β-amyloid precursor protein
β-Amyloid Precursor Protein (βAPP), a transmembrane
protein, might have three diﬀerent fates due to three distinct
protease activities. 

[CHUNK 14777]
α-secretase and β-secretase are cell surface
proteases, whereas γ-secretase is an abnormal protease that cleaves
membrane proteins inside their transmembrane regions. 

[CHUNK 14778]
Ninety
percentage of APP is cleaved primarily by the α -secretase,
preventing the synthesis of the Aβ peptide.

of APP is cleaved by β and γ secretases to create either the
harmless Aβ 40 peptide or the Aβ 42 peptide. 

[CHUNK 14785]
Because the Aβ
42 peptide is more likely to aggregate than its A40 form, it is
believed to be neurotoxic (26). 

[CHUNK 14786]
Regarding previous statements,
mutations in the gene encoding APP could cause substantial excess
production of either total Aβ or increased Aβ-40/Aβ-42 ratio. 

[CHUNK 14787]
This
rise causes the accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ 42, which, based on
the “amyloid hypothesis”, is the key and initial pathogenic event
in all types of AD, monogenic or sporadic (8, 27).

is supported by the fact that Down syndrome individuals with
three copies of the APP gene (on chromosome 21) generally
acquire the neuropathological abnormalities of AD by age 40 (28).


[CHUNK 14789]
Less than one percent of early-onset individuals have pathogenic
mutations in APP (21, 29). 

[CHUNK 14790]
In addition to harmful mutations,
a protective variant called p. A673T was found in APP among
Icelandic individuals. 

[CHUNK 14791]
This variant is linked to a decrease in the
production of the Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 peptides by ∼40% (30).


[CHUNK 14792]
4.2 The presenilin 1 and 2 genes
PSEN1 and PSEN2 are both required proteins of the γ -
secretase complex’s catalytic core, which initiates the cleavage of
APP (29). 

[CHUNK 14793]
Mutant γ -secretase signiﬁcantly shifts in Aβ1- 42/Aβ1-
40 ratio; due to that, mutations in PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes are
related to AD pathogenesis (31). 

[CHUNK 14794]
The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
PSEN1 and 2 is the age at the onset, which PSEN1 is distinguished
by, on average, 8.4 and 14.2 years younger onset than APP and
PSEN2 mutations (32, 33). 

[CHUNK 14795]
Mutations in PSEN1 causes the majority
of familial EOAD cases. 

[CHUNK 14796]
About 6% of EOAD patients have PSEN1
mutations, which cause the most severe type of AD (21). 

[CHUNK 14797]
In
contrast, PSEN2 mutations are uncommon, accounting for <1%
of EOAD patients, and they may exhibit incomplete penetrance
(21). 

[CHUNK 14798]
Besides the three recognized causative AD genes, other well-
replicated genes, including uncommon heterozygous mutations
with low penetrance, aﬀect the development of familial AD (34).


[CHUNK 14799]
4.3 Apolipoprotein E
APOE gene on chromosome 19q13, which encodes the protein
that makes up numerous plasma lipoproteins, was shown to be
the primary susceptible gene in individuals with familial LOAD
(21, 35–37). 

[CHUNK 14800]
The three frequently encountered isoforms of APOE
are ε2, –ε3, and –ε4. 

[CHUNK 14801]
The most frequent form is ε3/ε3, which does
not aﬀect the development of AD (38). 

[CHUNK 14802]
Nearly 40% of AD patients
have the APOE 4 allele, demonstrating a signiﬁcant risk-increasing
impact of this isoform, which is also linked to the earlier onset of
the disease (38, 39). 

[CHUNK 14803]
However, this association is dose-dependent,
meaning that if a person has two copies of ε4, they are more prone
to experience symptoms at a younger age compared to someone
with only one copy (36). 

[CHUNK 14804]
So individuals who are homozygote for
the ε4/ε4 gene tend to develop AD 10–15 years earlier than the
average population (26). 

[CHUNK 14805]
The ε2 allele, which is less common,
seems to exert protective and beneﬁcial eﬀects when inherited
alongside the ε3 allele, as opposed to individuals who carry two
copies of the ε3 allele (40, 41). 

[CHUNK 14806]
It is intriguing to note that while
there is extensive molecular evidence linking APOE protein to AD-
speciﬁc pathways, associations have been found between mutations
in the APOE gene and the risk of various other neuropsychiatric
disorders such as multiple sclerosis (42) and Parkinson’s disease
(43). 

[CHUNK 14807]
Additionally, the APOE gene has supposed to be linked to
age-related macular degeneration (44), several cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases (45, 46), and even longevity (41, 47).


[CHUNK 14808]
4.4 Inheritance patterns of AD
A person with autosomal dominant inheritance has a 50%
probability of transferring the disease-causing mutation to each
oﬀspring (48). 

[CHUNK 14809]
If a person receives two mutant copies of a gene,
one from each parent, the condition is said to be autosomal
recessive. 

[CHUNK 14810]
This would imply that while neither parent exhibits
signs of the disorder, both parents contain a copy of a defective
gene (22). 

[CHUNK 14811]
Due to the identiﬁcation of highly penetrant dominant
AD-causing mutations, it has become widely believed that all
instances of EOAD are caused by dominant alleles (49). 

[CHUNK 14812]
It has
been found through epidemiologic data that this belief is not
consistent. 

[CHUNK 14813]
Only about 10% of all cases follow this pattern, and
the remaining 90% stay unexplained (50). 

[CHUNK 14814]
A study carried out
in 2012 demonstrated the genetic aspects of EOAD and the
probable mechanism of inheritance by analyzing concordance
between parents and oﬀspring. 

[CHUNK 14815]
Wingo et al. 

[CHUNK 14816]
concluded that EOAD
is completely linked to genetic mutations, but they declined
an entirely dominant inheritance. 

[CHUNK 14817]
They reported that EOAD is
caused by autosomal recessive in most cases, and just 10% of
individuals may be attributed to dominant variants (22). 

[CHUNK 14818]
Autosomal
inheritance is associated with EOAD, while LOAD inherits through
a complex inheritance pattern, which refers to the complex nature
of AD, that has been inﬂuenced by multiple factors, including
genetic, environmental factors, and lifestyle (51).


[CHUNK 14819]
5 Environmental and behavioral
factors
Several environmental and behavioral factors can potentially
inﬂuence AD, including smoking, poor sleep quality, chronic stress,
physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, poor
diet, and social isolation, which are detailed further below.


[CHUNK 14820]
5.1 Smoking
Although smoking is primarily considered a risk factor for
a variety of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, it is now
undeniable that the negative health consequences of smoking
extend beyond the aforementioned conditions to include some
unexpected ones, such as neurocognitive and neurobiological
conditions (52, 53). 

[CHUNK 14821]
Despite the lack of research speciﬁcally
investigating the negative eﬀects of smoking on neurocognition and
neurobiology, current evidence suggests that chronic smoking is
associated with learning and memory deﬁcits, global brain atrophy,
and deﬁciencies in executive and intellectual abilities, all of which
can precipitate the development of various neurodegenerative
disorders, including AD (52). 

[CHUNK 14822]
Accounting for 14% of AD cases
worldwide, lifetime smoking is associated with earlier symptom
onset and a 70% greater risk of AD development, and the risk
Frontiers in Medicine

[CHUNK 14823]
Saﬁri et al.


[CHUNK 14824]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
increases signiﬁcantly with higher cumulative smoking exposure
(54, 55). 

[CHUNK 14825]
Although these estimates are signiﬁcant enough to
consider smoking as an important risk factor for AD, it should
be noted that there is even a possibility of an underestimation
in the magnitude of the risk due to an unavoidable survival bias,
which means that smokers who pass the selection process to enter
the studies are probably healthier than those who are overlooked,
and competing bias, which implies that the development of AD in
studied smokers is precluded by smoking-related mortality (56).


[CHUNK 14826]
Numerous potential mechanisms may contribute to smoking-
related AD neuropathology, either directly or indirectly (52).


[CHUNK 14827]
To begin with, cigarette smoke contains several potentially
cytotoxic and oxidizing constituents (e.g., phenolic compounds,
nitrosamines, carbon monoxide, and free radicals) (57). 

[CHUNK 14828]
Second, it
raises the concentrations of proinﬂammatory cytokines in various
parts of the brain, producing more free radicals (58). 

[CHUNK 14829]
Third, it
lowers the concentrations of glutathione and other antioxidants in
the brain due to the increased demand to scavenge the ampliﬁed
concentrations of free radicals (59). 

[CHUNK 14830]
All these mechanisms, along
with a few others that play minor roles, subject the brain to high
levels of oxidative stress, which increases Aβ production and tau
phosphorylation, potentially initiating the AD pathological process
(60, 61).


[CHUNK 14831]
5.2 Poor sleep quality
Clinical studies suggest a bidirectional link between sleep and
circadian sleep-wake rhythm disruptions and the developing of AD
(62, 63). 

[CHUNK 14832]
Poor sleep quality can exacerbate cognitive impairment in
AD patients, and the risk of sleep disturbances rises dramatically as
the disease progresses (64).


[CHUNK 14833]
There is growing evidence linking sleep disturbances to the
pathogenesis of AD (65). 

[CHUNK 14834]
Several studies have demonstrated that
sleep disturbances can increase Aβ levels in animal disease models
and humans (66). 

[CHUNK 14835]
A cross-sectional study indicated sleeping for 6 h
or less was associated with more Aβ accumulation and decreased
cognitive performance, particularly in memory (67).


[CHUNK 14836]
Although sleep disturbances in AD are assumed to stem from
pathological processes arising from Aβ accumulation, there may
also be a bidirectional link between sleep-wake disruption and tau
pathology (68). 

[CHUNK 14837]
Lucey et al. 

[CHUNK 14838]
found that the non-rapid eye movement
(NREM) slow wave activity was inversely linked with tauopathy,
suggesting that changes in NREM slow wave activity could help us
detect tau pathology and cognitive impairment before or during the
very early stages of symptomatic AD (69).


[CHUNK 14839]
The pathogenesis of sleep disturbances and AD is not limited
to pathological aspects alone; neuroinﬂammation is also a possible
mechanism that connects these two issues (70). 

[CHUNK 14840]
Abnormal sleep-
wake cycles boost the synthesis of microglia Iba-1 and astrocyte
glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein and increase microglia-mediated
proinﬂammatory release, further promoting the aggregation of Aβ
and tau (71).


[CHUNK 14841]
Besides these processes, the glymphatic system contributes
signiﬁcantly to the association between sleep and AD. 

[CHUNK 14842]
The
glymphatic system is a fast exchange and ﬂow mechanism between
Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and brain interstitial ﬂuid (ISF) that
relies on aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on the end foot of astrocytes to
remove metabolites and abnormal proteins in the brain (72).


[CHUNK 14843]
Notably, ﬂuid transport in the glymphatic system modulates
lymphatic clearance periodically since it occurs during sleep,
prolonged wave sleep, and it is inhibited during waking (73). 

[CHUNK 14844]
Sleep
disruptions can impair the glymphatic system function, resulting in
Aβ and tau accumulation (66).


[CHUNK 14845]
5.3 Chronic stress
Evidence
from
both
animal
and
human
studies
has
demonstrated that chronic stress exposure detrimentally aﬀects
cognitive processes in many ways (74). 

[CHUNK 14846]
Animal studies have shown
that chronic stress and higher levels of glucocorticoids lead to
structural remodeling in brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus (74). 

[CHUNK 14847]
This remodeling includes neuronal
atrophy (75), dendritic shortening and spine loss (76, 77), and
the suppression of neurogenesis (78). 

[CHUNK 14848]
These changes ultimately
result in cognitive impairments (79, 80). 

[CHUNK 14849]
In humans, chronic
stress experienced during early life or adulthood has a signiﬁcant
impact on cognitive skills and the development of distinct
psychopathologies. 

[CHUNK 14850]
However, individual diﬀerences indicate that
diﬀerent factors like sex and genetic composition may also play an
essential role in the development of stress-related mental health
issues, including MCI and AD (81).


[CHUNK 14851]
Experimental evidence suggests that chronic stress and
glucocorticoids play a dual role in the development of AD (74).


[CHUNK 14852]
Their key function in developing the disease is indicated by
their ability to directly induce Tau hyperphosphorylation in rats’
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (82, 83). 

[CHUNK 14853]
In addition, external
glucocorticoids enhance the capacity of centrally administered Aβ
to trigger excessive phosphorylation of Tau epitopes linked to AD,
as well as the accumulation of Tau in the cytoplasm, and previous
exposure to stress exacerbates the biochemical and behavioral
consequences of glucocorticoids in animals infused with Aβ (82,
83). 

[CHUNK 14854]
Therefore, long-term exposure to stress and glucocorticoids
may have a gradual eﬀect on the development and advancement
of AD pathology (82).


[CHUNK 14855]
5.4 Physical inactivity
Physically active individuals have a decreased prevalence and
incidence of cognitive deﬁcits and dementia, including AD (84–
87). 

[CHUNK 14856]
A meta-analysis of 16 prospective studies involving 163,000
non-psychotic participants indicated a 28 and 45% reduction in
overall dementia and AD among those who were physically active
compared to those who were less active, respectively (88).


[CHUNK 14857]
Physical activity elicits several anatomic, cellular, and molecular
modiﬁcations in the brain through the activation of a cascade of
cellular and molecular processes that advance various physiologic
phenomena, such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, angiogenesis,
and stimulation of neurotrophic factors, which play a signiﬁcant
role in improving memory, learning, and brain plasticity (89–
94). 

[CHUNK 14858]
Normally, a dementia-free elderly will experience an annual
hippocampal shrinkage of 1–2% (95). 

[CHUNK 14859]
It has been demonstrated
that moderate intensity exercise training can signiﬁcantly reverse
the shrinkage process of the hippocampal volume (95). 

[CHUNK 14860]
A
1-year aerobic exercise intervention resulted in a 2% increase
in hippocampal volume and neutralized the normal decline that

[CHUNK 14862]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
occurs with aging (95), and older adults with life-long routine
exercise have larger brain volume and enhanced executive function
than those who are physically inactive (96). 

[CHUNK 14863]
Several studies have
also discovered an inverse association between the levels of physical
activity and the plasma and brain Aβ load in the elderly without
cognitive disorders (97, 98). 

[CHUNK 14864]
Moreover, a 6-month aerobic exercise
intervention in individuals with MCI resulted in a 24% reduction
in the plasma Aβ levels when compared to the levels found
in the control group (99). 

[CHUNK 14865]
These ﬁndings, along with those of
several preclinical studies on AD models (100–103), suggest that
exercise may signiﬁcantly regulate Aβ turnover and decrease tau
phosphorylation (104).


[CHUNK 14866]
Physical activity has been shown to have a positive eﬀect
on improving cognitive symptoms (105). 

[CHUNK 14867]
AD patients who
participated in a year-long moderate exercise program had a slower
decline in their ability to perform activities of daily living and
ameliorated their physical impairment (106, 107). 

[CHUNK 14868]
Additionally,
Aerobic exercise has been shown in some other studies to improve
memory performance and cognitive function in aging, MCI, and
AD patients (99, 108, 109).


[CHUNK 14869]
Therefore, recent evidence suggests that physical activity
strongly protects AD development, alleviates some AD-related
clinical signs and symptoms, and slows disease progression (105).


[CHUNK 14870]
However, it has yet to determine the optimal duration of the
activity, the type and intensity of the exercise, and when in a
person’s life it should transpire in order to optimize the potential
protective eﬀects (110).


[CHUNK 14871]
5.5 Excessive alcohol consumption
The epidemiological data concerning the association between
alcohol and cognitive decline and AD-type neurodegeneration
have generated signiﬁcant controversy, primarily due to the
inconsistent and variable measurement parameters of both alcohol
consumption and AD (111). 

[CHUNK 14872]
However, a discernible trend has
emerged, as indicated by epidemiological investigations, which
propose that moderate alcohol intake diminishes the incidence of
AD (112–114). 

[CHUNK 14873]
In contrast, heavy alcohol consumption increases
dementia and impairs cognitive and executive functioning (113,
115). 

[CHUNK 14874]
Acetylcholine release in the hippocampus region, which
improves learning and memory, is the most likely mechanism
implicated in the protective eﬀect of low alcohol consumption
on cognitive impairment (116). 

[CHUNK 14875]
Another proposed mechanism
could be considered as reducing cardiovascular risk factors such
as platelet aggregation or serum lipid proﬁle (116). 

[CHUNK 14876]
Also, alcoholic
beverages, particularly red wine, contain polyphenols such as
quercetin, morin, tannins, and resveratrol, which can inhibit
amyloid aggregation and reduce oxidative stress, inﬂammation,
and balance of protein homeostasis, all of which play essential
roles in AD pathology (117). 

[CHUNK 14877]
However, whether low alcohol
consumption protects against AD is still debated (111) due to
additional confounding factors such as the impact of social contact
on alcohol drinking and disparities in alcohol metabolism (118).


[CHUNK 14878]
In contrast, there is a greater degree of consensus in the
literature regarding the impact of heavy alcohol consumption
on the risk of developing AD and other types of dementia
(118). 

[CHUNK 14879]
Several studies have found a positive association between
heavy alcohol consumption and risk of AD and dementia
(114, 115, 119, 120); however, this has not been universally
observed (119). 

[CHUNK 14880]
Heavy alcohol consumption promotes a decline
in cognitive performance comparable to that observed in AD
(121). 

[CHUNK 14881]
Loss of cholinergic neurons detected in AD patients, as
well as hippocampal atrophy (122), have also been discovered
in individuals consuming ethanol (123, 124), establishing a link
between heavy alcohol consumption and cognitive decline, which
may ultimately lead to the development of AD. 

[CHUNK 14882]
A potential
mechanism suggested for alcohol to induce AD is through the
reduction of glymphatic function (125). 

[CHUNK 14883]
The glymphatic system
is crucial for the removal of brain waste, including Aβ (105).


[CHUNK 14884]
Since alcohol impairs glymphatic function, heavy drinking may
lead to Aβ accumulation by decreasing its clearance, precipitating
the cognitive dysfunctions observed in AD (105). 

[CHUNK 14885]
In addition to
the potential link to trigger dementia, alcohol abstinence after AD
diagnosis appears to ameliorate the initial cognitive impairment
noted (126). 

[CHUNK 14886]
Also, it suggests that heavy alcohol consumption not
only raises the risk of developing AD but also exacerbates its
progression (115).


[CHUNK 14887]
Overall, although numerous studies have investigated the
eﬀects of alcohol intake on AD, controversies still remain,
mainly due to the heterogeneity that exists between the studies
regarding the age of participants, pattern, and duration of alcohol
consumption, types of alcoholic drinks consumed, and underlying
medical conditions and comorbidities (118).


[CHUNK 14888]
5.6 Obesity
Several studies have concluded that midlife obesity, as evaluated
by anthropometric measures such as BMI or the waist-to-hip
ratio (WHR), is associated with an elevated risk of late-life AD
and dementia in general, regardless of other risk factors (127–
133). 

[CHUNK 14889]
However, most of these studies have also agreed that there
is a reverse causality impact, with BMI decreasing in the years
before dementia onset (134). 

[CHUNK 14890]
These studies demonstrated that the
association between BMI and dementia is likely to be due to two
distinct processes: a harmful eﬀect of higher BMI, which is visible
in long follow-up, and a reverse-causation eﬀect that makes a
higher BMI appear protective when the follow-up duration is short
(134). 

[CHUNK 14891]
In a prospective cohort study, the HR for AD was 0.89
(95% CI 0.81–0.98) among those with high late-life BMI; however,
there was 20% increased risk of AD (95% CI 1.09–1.33) among
those with greater BMI decrease from midlife to late-life (131).


[CHUNK 14892]
Moreover, another study found that HRs per 5-Kg/m2 rise in BMI
for dementia were 0.71 (95% CI = 0.66–0.77), 0.94 (0.89–0.99),
and 1.16 (1.05–1.27) when BMI was measured 10, 10–20, and >20
years before dementia diagnosis (133). 

[CHUNK 14893]
It has been claimed that this
“obesity paradox” or weight loss just before and during the clinical
phase of dementia is linked to an increase in energy expenditure
and hypothalamic dysfunction (134).


[CHUNK 14894]
5.7 Poor diet
Low nutritional quality is strongly associated with cognitive
impairment and the development of AD (135). 

[CHUNK 14895]
Additionally,
Protein-calorie malnutrition increases the risk of mortality in AD

[CHUNK 14897]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
patients (136). 

[CHUNK 14898]
Consumption of reﬁned carbohydrates or a high
glycemic index diet can lead to increased Aβ peptide accumulation
in the brain (137). 

[CHUNK 14899]
This impact is even signiﬁcantly worse in APOE-
ε4 carriers (137). 

[CHUNK 14900]
However, the exact mechanisms of this association
are still not being unraveled (138, 139). 

[CHUNK 14901]
A western dietary pattern
increases the risk of AD by promoting inﬂammation, making
changes in metabolism, and decreasing cerebral perfusion, all of
which impair cognition (140). 

[CHUNK 14902]
On the contrary, adherence to the
Mediterranean diet is associated with a lower risk of developing
AD (137). 

[CHUNK 14903]
The Mediterranean diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, ﬁsh,
and whole-grain cereals, has been associated with better cognitive
outcomes, increased gray matter volume (141–143), and a lower
risk of developing MCI and AD, and of converting from MCI to
AD (144, 145).


[CHUNK 14904]
While it is clear that adherence to the Mediterranean
diet
improves
cardiovascular
health
and
protects
against
cerebrovascular diseases (146, 147), the protective association
between Mediterranean diet and AD does not appear to be
mediated by its eﬀects on stroke or vascular risk factors (148).


[CHUNK 14905]
A 3-year serial amyloid and FDG-PET imaging study found
that middle-aged cognitively healthy adults who followed a
Mediterranean-style diet showed lower amyloid plaque deposition
and cerebral hypometabolism, regardless of APOE genotype or
vascular risk factors (149). 

[CHUNK 14906]
This ﬁnding supports the protective
eﬀect of the Mediterranean diet against AD (134).


[CHUNK 14907]
A ketogenic diet may also be eﬀective in preventing AD,
as it reduces oxidative stress, inﬂammation, and the harmful
consequences of altered glucose metabolism in the brain. 

[CHUNK 14908]
Moreover,
it can improve attention, verbal memory, and overall cognitive
performance (137).


[CHUNK 14909]
Furthermore, appropriate omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,
particularly EPA and DHA, are related to slower cognitive decline
and a lower risk of AD (137). 

[CHUNK 14910]
As a result, it is critical to counsel
people at risk of developing of AD to consume sources of omega-3
such as seeds, ﬁsh, nuts, ﬁsh, and vegetable oils (150, 151).


[CHUNK 14911]
5.8 Social isolation
Social isolation, traditionally known for its detrimental eﬀects
on both mental and physical wellbeing, has been shown to
deteriorate cognitive function, accelerate psychological aspects of
aging, and increase the likelihood of developing AD and overall
dementia (152–155). 

[CHUNK 14912]
However, it should be highlighted that this
relationship is bidirectional, as early symptoms of AD may also
lead the person to feel socially isolated (152). 

[CHUNK 14913]
Social isolation has
two aspects: objective, which includes the lack of social networks
and reduced engagement in social activities, and perceived, which
encompasses feelings of loneliness and inadequate social support
(156). 

[CHUNK 14914]
Evidence suggests a strong correlation between these aspects
and cognitive decline (152).


[CHUNK 14915]
Social
isolation
may
inﬂuence
AD
development
via
psychological and neurobiological pathways (152). 

[CHUNK 14916]
According
to the cognitive reserve hypothesis, the brain uses pre-existing
cognitive processes or activates compensating pathways to deal
with brain damage (157). 

[CHUNK 14917]
Lower education and occupational
attainment and decreased participation in leisure activities have
been associated with a lower cognitive reserve (157) and an
increased risk of developing AD (158, 159). 

[CHUNK 14918]
Social isolation reduces
cognitive stimulation, potentially leading to lower cognitive
reserve, thereby increasing the risk of cognitive decline (160).


[CHUNK 14919]
6 Medical conditions
Several studies have investigated the link between AD and other
health conditions. 

[CHUNK 14920]
Numerous studies have implied the link between
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and dementia (161, 162). 

[CHUNK 14921]
Follow-
up of individuals with diﬀerent levels of cognitive impairment,
ranging from normal cognitive function to impaired cognition as
dementia level, shows that adverse vascular risk, as measured by
the Framingham cardiovascular risk proﬁle (FCRP), is associated
with the decline of multiple domains of the cognitive function,
and progression of AD (161–165). 

[CHUNK 14922]
In a prospective cohort of
3,602 patients without dementia, during a follow-up of 5.4 years,
participants who had CVD or peripheral artery disease showed
a 30 and 140% higher risk, respectively, for progression to AD
(166). 

[CHUNK 14923]
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is not only a major risk factor
for CVD, but also has a signiﬁcant role in developing AD
independently. 

[CHUNK 14924]
Previous large-scale cohorts indicate that patients
with diabetes mellitus (DM) or even prediabetic individuals are
faced with an increased risk of cognitive deterioration, dementia,
and AD (167, 168). 

[CHUNK 14925]
Consistent with these ﬁndings, population-
based data has revealed DM is considered to be responsible for
about 2.9% of new cases of AD worldwide and a 46% excessive
risk for projecting AD (169). 

[CHUNK 14926]
A cohort study on patients with type
1 DM concluded that long-term exposure to poorly controlled
hyperglycemia (i.e., HbA1C ≥8%) is correlated with a higher risk
of developing dementia (170). 

[CHUNK 14927]
On the other hand, in a prospective
cohort of randomly selected 416 patients with a long history
of type 1 DM from the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions
and Complications (EDIC) and 99 sociodemographically matched
control participants, pattern analysis of the participants’ brain
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) unveiled that type 1 DM is
correlated with brain atrophy in the thalamus, putamen, superior
and middle frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus, consistent
with a nearly 6 years older brain age. 

[CHUNK 14928]
However, the association
of type 1 DM and patterns consistent with early AD-related
neurodegeneration was not conﬁrmed (171).


[CHUNK 14929]
A recently published meta-analysis of incidence and cohort
studies suggested depression is associated with 82% extra risk for
the development of dementia (172). 

[CHUNK 14930]
The results of prior-published
meta-analyses show that late-life depression augments the risk of
all-cause dementia (173, 174). 

[CHUNK 14931]
Population-based data represents
a 65% excessive risk attributed to depression for developing AD,
yielding 7.9% cases of the disease (169). 

[CHUNK 14932]
Longitudinal follow-ups of
diﬀerent cohorts of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) signify
the variable incidence of newly diagnosed dementia among this
population, changing from 30 to 112.5 per every 1,000 person-
years (175–183). 

[CHUNK 14933]
Previous cohort studies exhibit a multiplied
risk, even near to 6-fold greater, in patients with PD compared
to the control population without PD (177, 180, 181, 184). 

[CHUNK 14934]
A
more recent post-hoc analysis on patients in PARKreg registry
showed an approximate 4-fold increased risk associated with PD
for progression to dementia, compared to sex- and age-matched

individuals without PD (185). 

[CHUNK 14937]
However, a neuropsychological
comparison of patients with dementia associated with PD and
individuals with AD has revealed comparable memory impairment,
while diﬀerent cognitive proﬁles regard orientation and attention
tests (186).


[CHUNK 14938]
Prior investigations on the association of hypothyroidism with
dementia have inconsistent results. 

[CHUNK 14939]
Retrospective assessment
of
patients
with
AD
illustrates
the
higher
prevalence
of
hypothyroidism in this population compared to those without AD
(187, 188). 

[CHUNK 14940]
Similarly, analysis of data from diﬀerent case-control
studies has conﬁrmed the increased risk of progression to AD
among patients with hypothyroidism (189, 190). 

[CHUNK 14941]
Assessments
of patients derived from two prospective cohorts (DNPR and
OPENTHYRO) suggested the increased risk for projection to
dementia among patients with hypothyroidism. 

[CHUNK 14942]
They claimed
that the risk of dementia increases by 12% every 6 months of
elevated TSH level (191). 

[CHUNK 14943]
Longitudinal prospective follow-up
of 1,836 persons with intact cognitive proﬁles derived from the
Framingham cohort revealed that during a mean follow-up of 12.7
years, although elevated levels of thyroid stimulating hormone
were associated with 115% higher risk for development of AD in
the population of women, the risk among men was similar with
diﬀerent levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (192). 

[CHUNK 14944]
However,
some other investigations claim that hypothyroidism, either as
clinical or as subclinical, is not associated with the incidence of
cognitive deﬁcit (193). 

[CHUNK 14945]
Interestingly, available meta-analyses in
this entity have proved controversial results. 

[CHUNK 14946]
A meta-analysis of
15 diﬀerent longitudinal and cross-sectional studies concluded
that both clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism are accompanied
by an increased risk of dementia (194). 

[CHUNK 14947]
On the other hand,
another meta-analysis of eight studies with a pooled population
of 1,092,025 patients conversely showed that after adjustment
for vascular risk factors, hypothyroidism is even associated with
reduced risk for cognitive deterioration (195).


[CHUNK 14948]
The role of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in progression to
AD has remained contradictory. 

[CHUNK 14949]
Cross-sectional data unveiled that
alteration of cognitive function is concordant with the severity
of the renal impairment, as patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD or stage 5 of CKD) have acquired worse scores on diﬀerent
cognitive tests compared to those with stage 3 or 4 of CKD (196).


[CHUNK 14950]
In cognitive evaluation of 825 patients derived from the CRIC
study (a prospective cohort for assessment of risk factors and
mechanisms of progression of CKD and CVD) with age more
than 55 years old and diﬀerent levels of baseline kidney function,
lower estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) at the time of
evaluation was accompanied with worse scores in most cognitive
domains (197). 

[CHUNK 14951]
In a prospective cohort of 7,839 patients, a fast
decline in estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) (i.e., > 4
mL/min/1.73 m2/year) was associated with more than 5-fold higher
risk for developing dementia with vascular component and greater
cognitive deterioration compared to those with lower rate of eGFR
decline, during the ﬁrst 4 years of follow-up. 

[CHUNK 14952]
However, presence
of CKD at the baseline did not correlate with the incidence of
dementia or cognitive decline in the 7-year follow-up (198). 

[CHUNK 14953]
More
recent data has shown debatable results. 

[CHUNK 14954]
A longitudinal follow-up
study on the Korean National Health Screening Cohort concluded
that CKD is associated with an increased risk of AD (199).


[CHUNK 14955]
Unexpectedly, another prospective cohort of 205,622 patients
stratiﬁed based on the baseline eGFR revealed a remarkably higher
risk for AD among patients belonging to strata with baseline eGFR
of 30–89 mL/min/m2, while patients with baseline eGFR of < 30
mL/min/m2 showed a signiﬁcantly higher risk for developing AD
only after further adjustment for medications, and to a lower extent
compared with baseline eGFR of 30–89 mL/min/m2. 

[CHUNK 14956]
However, the
risk of all-cause dementia was consistent with the level of renal
impairment, as worse baseline eGFR was associated with a higher
risk of projecting all-cause dementia (200). 

[CHUNK 14957]
In contrast, a 17-year
prospective follow-up of a cohort of 6,256 patients unveiled that
renal impairment (deﬁned as eGFR < 60 mL/min/m2) increases
the risk for neither all-cause dementia nor AD, despite its strong
association with an increase in the level of dementia-related blood
biomarkers (201).


[CHUNK 14958]
7 Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease
AD is a common, invaluable, and sporadic degenerative
brain disorder. 

[CHUNK 14959]
It is not just a decrease in brain volume and
weight but a progressive, extensive atrophy of the cerebrum. 

[CHUNK 14960]
This
condition involves a signiﬁcant loss of neural cells, especially in
the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes, conﬁrmed through
pathological tests (202). 

[CHUNK 14961]
Additionally, clinical evaluations must be
completed before accepting an AD diagnosis and diﬀerentiating
it from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) syndrome. 

[CHUNK 14962]
These
diagnostic criteria consist of detecting dementia in patients older
than 40 years using each of the clinical questionnaires of the Mini-
Mental Scale (MMSE), Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (BDRS),
or Alzheimer Disease Status Assessment Scale (ADAS) which
aﬀects at least 2 areas of cognitive functions either memory,
language, perception, visuospatial, psychosocial, or motor skills
(203). 

[CHUNK 14963]
However, MCI is deﬁned as the presence of cognitive
abnormalities in at least 1 ﬁeld that does not interfere with routine
daily activities (204). 

[CHUNK 14964]
Here we separately discuss each of presenting
symptoms in the early and late stages of AD.


[CHUNK 14965]
It’s been mentioned in the literature that the clinical course of
the disease could vary from usually more than 5 years up to 20
years after its establishment using CSF analysis and neuroimaging
ﬁndings (205), but further investigations revealed that the onset
of the molecular course of this ominous illness could be much
longer as in the familial AD which 15 years or longer has
been indicated (206). 

[CHUNK 14966]
More often, the beginning of the mental
symptoms, prominently memory deﬁcit as the most common
and most important one, occurs insidiously. 

[CHUNK 14967]
Still, occasionally, a
febrile episode, traumatic brain injury, surgery, or commencement
of a new drug exploit the underlying process. 

[CHUNK 14968]
Discussing the
course of AD, lacking a plateau condition or cessation of
the disease progression has been declared, and the absence of
symptom deterioration for a long period infers other diagnoses
such as frontotemporal dementia, hydrocephalus, temporoparietal
embolic infarcts, or Binswanger disease (207). 

[CHUNK 14969]
Eventually, the
debilitated and incapacitated patient dies due to conditions related
to worsening cognitive disabilities, severe weakness, and being
bedridden, such as cardiovascular or pulmonary dysfunctions.


[CHUNK 14970]
Memory impairment, as a commonly manifested symptom in
∼90% of AD patients, primarily aﬀects short-term and episodic
memory, even if it presents as the only symptom in patients for

several years. 

[CHUNK 14973]
However, immediate or working memory, which is
relatively proportionate to the patient’s attention, often remains
intact (208). 

[CHUNK 14974]
On the other side, despite the severe demolition
of long-term memory in late-stage AD patients, no signiﬁcant
changes could be detected in early-diagnosed patients. 

[CHUNK 14975]
Forgotten
appointments, misplacing household items, frequently repeating
the same questions, and having inconclusive and imperfect
discussions are some of the common symptom (209, 210).


[CHUNK 14976]
Problems in language usually occur when memory dysfunction
reaches a prominent level. 

[CHUNK 14977]
As a result of being unable to reach the
necessary word, the patient stutters and uses words stereotypically
due to decreased word variety (211). 

[CHUNK 14978]
The same problem prevents
from proper writing, and the spelling precision diminishes. 

[CHUNK 14979]
These
linguistic abnormalities are ﬁrst hardly apparent but become
more noticeable as the illness worsens, eventually leading to
imperceptible discussions. 

[CHUNK 14980]
There is a lack of whole sentences after
several years of disease, prolonged phases of pauses, and word
searches that disrupt ordinary discourse. 

[CHUNK 14981]
Their struggle could lead
to substituting other words or comprising discontinued sentences.


[CHUNK 14982]
In later stages, echolalia and anomic aphasia would ensue in the
clinical course (212). 

[CHUNK 14983]
Despite the lack of isolated Wernicke’s or
Broca’s aphasia, which raises a suspicion of cerebral ischemia,
deterioration of anomic aphasia in the receptive or executive area
could be accepted in the disease course. 

[CHUNK 14984]
Dysnomia in AD patients
could be assessed using a test in which AD patients are asked to
declare as many names as possible related to a speciﬁc category
in 1 min (213). 

[CHUNK 14985]
Less than eight items in each mentioned category
strengthen AD disease diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 14986]
Seldom, debilitated language
function presents as the ﬁrst manifestation of the disease called the
logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) (214).


[CHUNK 14987]
The calculation could also be aﬀected, resulting in dyscalculia,
which is usually demonstrated by faulty account management,
incorrect money changes, and aggravated form disability in even
calculating the most straightforward arithmetic (215). 

[CHUNK 14988]
Altered
decision-making also could be detected but it has been mentioned
that repeatedly established work habits by business experts are not
drastically aﬀected at least during the early stages (216).


[CHUNK 14989]
Disorientation to time and place is an early symptom that
is observed in Alzheimer’s individuals. 

[CHUNK 14990]
It means the inability of
memory to update information about time and place (217, 218).


[CHUNK 14991]
It may be experienced while entering new places or relocating
to a new house, but it also can be experienced in daily and
routine environments (219). 

[CHUNK 14992]
Individuals became confused about
seasons and dates and even recognized day or night. 

[CHUNK 14993]
Visuospatial
disorientation is a related condition that could be attributed to
parieto-occipital dysfunction and may be detected in a variable
proportion of AD patients (220). 

[CHUNK 14994]
Its pure occurrence, which
may induce complete cortical blindness, is deﬁned as posterior
cortical atrophy (221). 

[CHUNK 14995]
Defective recognition of similar faces
(called prosopagnosia), diﬃculties in dressing up or parking a
car, inability to distinguish the correct way back home or giving
directions to other people in despite of a bunch of familiar clues,
feeble interpretation of maps, or even inaccurate right or left
side detection.


[CHUNK 14996]
Functional
and
executive
disturbances,
which
can
be
considered the most disabling aspect in AD patients, partly
resulting
from
the
underlying
decline
in
cognitive
and
neuropsychological functions. 

[CHUNK 14997]
Further, concomitant restrictions
in working and learning competencies, including defective task
coordination and inability to perform complicated instructions,
aggravate
self-esteem
and
result
in
dissociation
from
the
community, depression, resignment, ﬁnancial problems, and
initiation of a vicious circle (222, 223). 

[CHUNK 14998]
Early incapacitation
implementing complex orders exacerbates, and doing easier,
previously automatic activities like driving get troublesome.


[CHUNK 14999]
Locomotor abnormalities may appear early, with walking speed
being the most commonly altered parameter. 

[CHUNK 15000]
However, Gras et al.


[CHUNK 15001]
(224) reported that crude unsteady balance, sluggish gait speed,
increased stance time, and shorter step length could be detected
in AD individuals. 

[CHUNK 15002]
Advanced stages could be presented by ﬁne
tremors and rigidity resembling Parkinson’s disease (225). 

[CHUNK 15003]
Later
in the disease course, primary reﬂexes of grasping and sucking
reappear, and the patient loses his continence of sphincters which
accompanying moving and standing impairments, bed rest,
and subsequent vegetative conditions ensue, which necessitates
persistent patient care (226).


[CHUNK 15004]
Most AD patients have behavioral impairment throughout their
illnesses, which predominates in later stages, while other cognitive
or functional areas are mild to severely aﬀected. 

[CHUNK 15005]
Incautious actions
or decisions are made without any attention to feedback. 

[CHUNK 15006]
The
patient’s aﬀect becomes harsher as he becomes more self-centered,
rejecting to see old friends or family members and uncaring about
how others see him. 

[CHUNK 15007]
Depressive symptoms, including reduced
or heightened food intake, irritability or inertia, disinhibition,
sleeplessness or hypersomnia, and repetitive or obsessive behaviors,
may occur. 

[CHUNK 15008]
Although sometimes a ravenous hunger sets in,
commonly eating is disregarded, leading to a slow but steady weight
loss. 

[CHUNK 15009]
Neglected self-care and a wildly disheveled general outlook
are also frequently reported (227). 

[CHUNK 15010]
Anhedonia and apathy are often
encountered owing to the frontal lobe involvement with associated
lassitude in starting a novel task, lack of consistency, and deﬁcient
motivation, but anxieties and sometimes phobias can occur with
an aversion to being alone (228). 

[CHUNK 15011]
A patient’s sexual misdeeds or
attraction to a younger person may shock friends and family yet
threaten to destabilize an otherwise successful marriage. 

[CHUNK 15012]
Paranoid
delusions, sometimes accompanied by hallucinations, could be
other manifestations of AD patients. 

[CHUNK 15013]
The patient’s children may be
accused of stealing from him or his old wife may be suspected of
having an extramarital inﬁdelity (229).

8 Symptoms and signs assessed during
a physical examination for Alzheimer’s
disease
Since AD aﬀects diﬀerent areas of the central nervous system,
signs and symptoms of this disease vary greatly. 

[CHUNK 15015]
So, it is essential to
do a proper physical examination (230).


[CHUNK 15016]
8.1 Memory loss and cognitive impairment
Memory loss and cognitive impairment are key indicators of
AD. 

[CHUNK 15017]
The severity of cognitive impairment correlates best with the
burden of neocortical neuroﬁbrillary tangles, which are a hallmark

Saﬁri et al.


[CHUNK 15019]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
of AD (231). 

[CHUNK 15020]
Memory loss is among the ﬁrst symptoms reported by
patients suﬀering from AD. 

[CHUNK 15021]
Disease pathology interferes with the
formation of memories from the molecular level to the framework
of neural networks (232). 

[CHUNK 15022]
Prospective studies indicate an early
decline in executive functions and episodic and semantic memory
processing in the predementia period (233). 

[CHUNK 15023]
Low performance
in learning and memory functions may be the earliest cognitive
manifestations of preclinical AD (234). 

[CHUNK 15024]
Also, asymmetry in
cognitive abilities may occur in the preclinical phase of AD (235).


[CHUNK 15025]
Memory test scores reﬂecting the diﬀerence between immediate
and delayed recall are important in identifying which individuals
with recent cognitive changes will progress to where they meet
the criteria for Alzheimer’s over time (236). 

[CHUNK 15026]
Episodic memory
decline is the most salient cognitive function that correlates with
high levels of amyloid deposition and hypoconnectivity across
large-scale brain networks (233).


[CHUNK 15027]
8.2 Changes in behavior or personality
Personality changes occur alongside or sometimes before
cognitive symptoms (237, 238). 

[CHUNK 15028]
A systematic review showed
increased neuroticism and decreased extraversion, openness,
agreeableness, and conscientiousness (239, 240). 

[CHUNK 15029]
A signiﬁcant
change from positive to negative characteristics in personality is
detected after the beginning of AD (241).


[CHUNK 15030]
8.3 Loss of coordination or balance
Balance and mobility impairments are linearly correlated with
cognitive function and can be observed at the beginning of the
subjective cognitive decline stage (242). 

[CHUNK 15031]
For instance, an impaired
one-leg balance test indicates a higher cognitive decline (243).


[CHUNK 15032]
Standing balance in people with AD is signiﬁcantly impaired across
a range of static and dynamic balance conditions. 

[CHUNK 15033]
Activity level,
mobility measures, turning, and dual tasks are also impaired (244).


[CHUNK 15034]
8.4 Abnormal gait
Gait parameters can diﬀerentiate between healthy elderly,
mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients (245). 

[CHUNK 15035]
Gait analysis
can potentially contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of
cognitive impairment (246). 

[CHUNK 15036]
Dual-tasking frequently results in gait
disturbances, which may aﬀect gait stability and increase the risk
of falling (247). 

[CHUNK 15037]
Overall, gait analysis can be a useful tool for
identifying AD and monitoring its progression.


[CHUNK 15038]
8.5 Loss of sensation or reﬂexes
Loss of sensation may be an indicator of AD. 

[CHUNK 15039]
AD patients
have a sensory gating deﬁcit, which may result from cholinergic
dysfunction and alpha-7 nicotinic receptor loss (248). 

[CHUNK 15040]
They also
have an impaired sensation of pain, which means their pain
tolerance is increased, and their reaction to pain is markedly
diminished (249, 250). 

[CHUNK 15041]
Loss of reﬂexes may be a relevant sign in
the diagnosis of AD. 

[CHUNK 15042]
The palmomental reﬂex is more frequent
in AD patients even 2 years before diagnosing AD (251). 

[CHUNK 15043]
Also
the prevalence of primitive reﬂexes is correlated with dementia
severity (252).


[CHUNK 15044]
8.6 Abnormal eye movements or vision
Abnormal eye movement or vision can indicate AD. 

[CHUNK 15045]
Eye
movements, including saccades and smooth pursuit, seem to be
slower and less accurate as a result of the disease. 

[CHUNK 15046]
Even subtle
functions, such as microsaccades and pupillary dilations, are
changed by AD (253). 

[CHUNK 15047]
A decrease in concentration is one of the
symptoms that comes with cognitive decline, which causes frequent
eye and facial movements. 

[CHUNK 15048]
These diﬀerences can be used to screen
AD symptoms quickly, even with camera recordings (254).


[CHUNK 15049]
Among the earliest symptoms seen in AD patients are visual
impairments, particularly loss of contrast and color sensitivity,
limited visual ﬁeld, compromised visual attention, reduced
stereopsis, and impaired object and face recognition (255–259).


[CHUNK 15050]
Anatomical changes within the eye have been detected before signs
of cognitive impairment and memory loss appear (257). 

[CHUNK 15051]
All parts
of the visual system, including the optic nerve and the retina,
may be aﬀected in AD (260). 

[CHUNK 15052]
According to a systematic review,
the peripapillary retinal nerve ﬁber layer (RNFL) and macular
thickness are signiﬁcantly decreased in AD patients (261).


[CHUNK 15053]
8.7 Tremors or other involuntary
movements
Among motor signs during AD, tremor is the least frequent
and appears independent of disease progression (262–266). 

[CHUNK 15054]
As
AD progresses, the frequency of motor signs like speech/facial
expression, rigidity, posture/gait, and bradykinesia also increase
(266, 267).


[CHUNK 15055]
As reviewed above, the physical examination results can help
us diagnose AD, and in some cases, even better and sooner. 

[CHUNK 15056]
Other
diagnostic assessments are used with physical examination and can
either conﬁrm our diagnosis or rule out other diseases (268–270).


[CHUNK 15057]
AD is a slow and progressive disorder, and it’s been diﬃcult
for clinicians to identify the transitions from the asymptomatic
phase to the symptomatic predementia and dementia phase
(270). 

[CHUNK 15058]
In cases of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), physical
examination alone can’t indicate the progression to AD, and
here, the biomarkers are a great help in identifying this matter
(271, 272). 

[CHUNK 15059]
Additionally, all cognitive tests are inﬂuenced by some
unchangeable variables like age, education, and cultural variations
between individuals (270).

development of a blood test for AD. 

[CHUNK 15063]
Yet, the use of blood tests for
AD has not been implemented in clinical settings (273).


[CHUNK 15064]
Recent research has shown that the Aβ42/40 ratio, as
determined in plasma, can distinguish between individuals without
cognitive impairment and those with AD. 

[CHUNK 15065]
However, it is worth
noting that this particular technology is not widely available in
most healthcare facilities (274, 275). 

[CHUNK 15066]
The blood plasma levels of
Aβ42 exhibit changes similar to those previously documented in
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF), suggesting a potential pathway to transit
Aβ between the blood and the brain through the blood-brain
barrier (BBB). 

[CHUNK 15067]
The stability and sensitivity of plasma Aβ values
indicate that this screening test may be helpful in detecting central
nervous system (CNS) amyloidosis (275).


[CHUNK 15068]
Another non-invasive diagnostic and predictive biomarker
for AD is plasma P-tau181, which may be helpful in clinical
practice and studies (276). 

[CHUNK 15069]
Plasma P-tau181 was shown to be
elevated in preclinical AD and further elevated in the MCI and
dementia phases in research by Janelidze et al. 

[CHUNK 15070]
They demonstrated
that Plasma P-tau181 had accuracy comparable to Tau PET
and CSF P-tau181, distinguished AD dementia from non-AD
neurodegenerative illnesses, and identiﬁed AD neuropathology in
a cohort with autopsy conﬁrmation (276). 

[CHUNK 15071]
When taken as a whole,
plasma P-tau181 may be a practical tool for identifying people who
need further diagnostic testing (277).


[CHUNK 15072]
9.2 Inﬂammatory markers
Intracellular alterations in individuals with AD may be detected
early by using inﬂammatory markers (278). 

[CHUNK 15073]
Interleukin-6, 12, and
18, as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming
growth factor (TGF), have been shown to be present in increased
concentrations in the blood of AD patients (279).


[CHUNK 15074]
Additionally, glial cells may become pro-inﬂammatory if
stimulated for an extended period, as in AD (280). 

[CHUNK 15075]
Microglia
and astrocytes express the inﬂammatory marker chitinase-3-like
protein 1 (also known as YKL-40). 

[CHUNK 15076]
Astrocytes close to Aβ plaques
express YKL-40 in AD, and tau pathology positively correlates with
this expression (281, 282). 

[CHUNK 15077]
Another biomarker connected to AD’s
progression is glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP). 

[CHUNK 15078]
Prins et al.’s
cross-sectional investigation showed that preclinical AD patients
had higher plasma levels of GFAP than healthy controls (283).


[CHUNK 15079]
9.3 Cerebrospinal ﬂuid analysis
9.3.1 Aβ and tau protein levels
It was shown in 1992 that Aβ is secreted into the CSF
(284). 

[CHUNK 15080]
Numerous articles have conﬁrmed the reduction in CSF
A42 in AD dementia; a meta-analysis of 131 research revealed
extremely consistent results, with a mean fold change for CSF A42
of 0.56 compared with older individuals with normal cognitive
function (285).


[CHUNK 15081]
After a long-standing mystery, a 2003 autopsy investigation
linked low postmortem ventricular CSF Aβ42 levels to high plaque
numbers (286), which is consistent with the pathophysiological
theory that the hydrophobic peptide aggregates and becomes
sequestered in plaques in AD, leaving less of it to be secreted into
the extracellular space and the CSF, leading to lower CSF levels of A-
42 (287). 

[CHUNK 15082]
Other Aβ species than Aβ42 are discovered in human CSF,
with Aβ1-40 being the most prevalent and having around ten times
the amount of Aβ42 (288, 289). 

[CHUNK 15083]
Numerous investigations have
shown that while CSF Aβ40 levels remain relatively unchanged
in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is more
eﬀective than CSF Aβ42 alone in detecting AD (285, 290–292).


[CHUNK 15084]
Therefore, in a clinical environment, the CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio
could have diagnostic importance (293).


[CHUNK 15085]
Another biomarker for AD is tau, a microtubule-associated
protein found in neuronal axons with six distinct human isoforms
(294, 295). 

[CHUNK 15086]
Tau is hyperphosphorylated and is transported from
axons to the somatodendritic compartment in many AD neurons,
where it is misfolded and clumps.


[CHUNK 15087]
According to research, axonal loss and neuronal death cause the
intracellular protein tau to be released, increasing the tau level in
the CSF in AD (296, 297). 

[CHUNK 15088]
CSF T-tau levels are dynamic after acute
brain trauma, rising within days after the lesion and remaining
high for weeks until returning to normal (298, 299). 

[CHUNK 15089]
However,
in some pure tauopathies, CSF tau is not raised despite severe
neurodegeneration and tau pathology (300, 301).


[CHUNK 15090]
9.3.2 Phosphorylated tau levels
Through
the
use
of
antibodies
that
target
distinct
phosphorylated patterns within the amino acid sequence of
tau (referred to as p-tau), some isoforms of p-tau (namely
p-tau181,−199, and−231) have been identiﬁed as exhibiting
a greater association with AD. 

[CHUNK 15091]
P-tau231 and P-tau181 may be
utilized to diﬀerentiate AD from control groups and even from
FTD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), vascular dementia (VaD),
and major depressive disorder (287, 300, 302–305). 

[CHUNK 15092]
There aren’t
many studies directly evaluating various CSF Ptau tests as AD
biomarkers, although one study found that P-Tau181, P-Tau199,
and Pau231 levels in CSF closely correlate and perform similarly
to distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases and
non-demented individuals (304). 

[CHUNK 15093]
Moreover, p-tau217 exhibits
signiﬁcant potential as a biomarker in Alzheimer’s disease, notably
due to its marked increase in levels ∼21 years prior to the onset
of symptoms, which closely correlates with the accumulation of
amyloid-β. 

[CHUNK 15094]
As the disease progresses, both p-tau217 and p-tau181
levels decline signiﬁcantly near the onset of symptoms, while total
tau levels and unphosphorylated isoforms (such as Tau217 and
Tau181) continue to rise (306). 

[CHUNK 15095]
This dynamic suggests that the
reduction in phosphorylation ratios is not solely attributable to
a rise in unphosphorylated peptides or a decline in overall tau
protein levels (306). 

[CHUNK 15096]
Instead, it signiﬁes a complex interaction of
tau phosphorylation that corresponds with the advancement of
Alzheimer’s pathology. 

[CHUNK 15097]
Recent research highlights the necessity
for additional validation of these tests to secure regulatory
approval, which entails standardizing measurement protocols and
conducting longitudinal studies across varied populations. 

[CHUNK 15098]
The
potential for early detection and monitoring of Tau217 ultimately
underscores its signiﬁcance in understanding Alzheimer’s disease
and guiding future treatment approaches (306).

[CHUNK 15100]
Saﬁri et al.


[CHUNK 15101]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
In individuals with moderate cognitive impairment (MCI)
(307) and with neocortical NFT pathology in AD (308), CSF p-tau
levels are correlated with cognitive deterioration. 

[CHUNK 15102]
Additionally, t-
tau and p-tau both predict the rate of cognitive decline in various
stages of AD (309–311). 

[CHUNK 15103]
The concentration of p-tau231 decreases
over time from mild to moderate AD (312). 

[CHUNK 15104]
It signiﬁcantly
correlates at baseline with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in mild
to moderate AD (313), indicating structural disease progression.


[CHUNK 15105]
In a European multi-center trial, CSF p-tau consistently predicted
AD in people with MCI with high accuracy (80%) over 1.5 years, a
period that was both brief and clinically meaningful (314).


[CHUNK 15106]
9.3.3 Neuroﬁlament light chain levels
Intermediate ﬁlaments, known as neuroﬁlaments, are found in
neurons and are especially prevalent in axons (315). 

[CHUNK 15107]
One of the four
components of neuroﬁlaments in the CNS is called neuroﬁlament
light (Nf-L). 

[CHUNK 15108]
Neuroﬁlaments have a crucial role in facilitating the
radial expansion of axons throughout the developmental process,
providing structural stability, and facilitating the conduction of
electrical signals (315). 

[CHUNK 15109]
Several neurological disorders, including
AD, exhibit abnormal neuroﬁlament aggregation and other
changes (315–317).


[CHUNK 15110]
The NF-L subunit’s involvement as a marker of axonal damage
is supported by the knowledge that CSF levels of the subunit
are elevated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders (318–
320). 

[CHUNK 15111]
As compared to controls, AD and MCI patients have
been demonstrated to have increased CSF NF-L levels (320–323).


[CHUNK 15112]
According to Olsson et al.’s meta-analysis (285), which included
data from nine AD cohorts and eight control cohorts, CSF NF-L
had a signiﬁcant eﬀect size for discriminating between AD patients
and controls. 

[CHUNK 15113]
CSF NF-L is correlated with brain atrophy (323, 324),
but it doesn’t seem to be particular to AD, since levels are raised in
other neurodegenerative disorders, possibly reﬂecting non-speciﬁc
axonal damage (324–326).


[CHUNK 15114]
9.4 Novel recently developed probable
diagnostic biomarkers
To identify reliable biomarkers in AD, researchers have
focused on measuring Aβ and tau in CSF and blood, as well
as using neuroimaging techniques such as FDG-PET, Pittsburgh
compound B-PET, and MRI to measure hippocampal volume
(327, 328). 

[CHUNK 15115]
It is now advised to use a multi-marker strategy since
none of these instruments can aid in diagnosing independently.


[CHUNK 15116]
As a result, the availability of non-invasive, readily accessible
biomarkers is very valuable. 

[CHUNK 15117]
Researchers have suggested various
new biomarkers, such as inﬂammatory markers, ﬂuorescent
nanoparticles, and microRNAs.


[CHUNK 15118]
According to a recent systematic review, a total of 10
microRNAs (miRNAs) have a substantially altered expression in
individuals with AD compared to normal subjects, as evidenced by
at least two independent investigations. 

[CHUNK 15119]
Furthermore, the research
highlights that over thirty miRNAs can diﬀerentiate between
two distinct neurodegenerative disorders (329). 

[CHUNK 15120]
AD patients ’
extracellular ﬂuid (ECF) and CSF were reported to have higher
levels of some miRNAs, including pro-inﬂammatory miRNA-9,
miRNA-125b, miRNA-146a, and miRNA-155 (330).


[CHUNK 15121]
One further potential biomarker for the diagnosis of AD is
ﬂuorescent nanoparticle kits. 

[CHUNK 15122]
The outcomes of eﬀorts to develop
these kits include the AD Diagnostic Kit WO2002/088706, which
uses glutamine synthetase as an indicator, and WO2010/144634,
which detects DNA methylation as an epigenetic marker to
diagnose AD (331). 

[CHUNK 15123]
Furthermore, Park et al. 

[CHUNK 15124]
conﬁrmed that the
ﬂuorescent nanoparticles they created and the WO2002/088706 kit
would potentially give an early diagnosis of AD using plasma from
AD patients (332).


[CHUNK 15125]
Inﬂammatory biomarkers, including IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α,
may be additional cutting-edge biomarkers for identifying AD due
to the inﬂammatory character of the disease. 

[CHUNK 15126]
However, a recent
meta-analysis by Ng et al. 

[CHUNK 15127]
found no diﬀerence in IL-6, CRP, and
TNF levels between elderly with AD and controls (333).


[CHUNK 15128]
10 Imaging tests for diagnosis of
Alzheimer’s disease
AD is a complex ailment mainly aﬀecting memory and
cognitive abilities. 

[CHUNK 15129]
Diagnosing it early and accurately ensures timely
treatment and patient care (334). 

[CHUNK 15130]
Advanced imaging techniques
assist physicians in conﬁrming clinical suspicions, identifying
those at risk, monitoring the eﬀectiveness of potential treatments,
diﬀerentiating Alzheimer’s from other conditions, and evaluating
the severity of the disease (335).


[CHUNK 15131]
10.1 Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging
technique that uses strong magnetic ﬁelds to generate detailed brain
images. 

[CHUNK 15132]
In AD diagnosis, MRI primarily assesses brain structure,
detects atrophy, and rules out other potential causes of cognitive
impairment, such as tumors or vascular abnormalities (336, 337).


[CHUNK 15133]
MRI scans reveal brain atrophy, particularly in regions critical
for memory formation (336, 337). 

[CHUNK 15134]
Advanced MRI techniques can
quantify microstructural changes and accurately measure brain
volume loss, aiding early AD detection and monitoring disease
progression (336, 337). 

[CHUNK 15135]
However, it should not be relied upon alone
in identifying evidence of AD due to its low accuracy (338). 

[CHUNK 15136]
The
sensitivity of MRI in detecting AD in patients with mild cognitive
impairment is 73%, and the speciﬁcity is 71% (338).


[CHUNK 15137]
10.2 Computed tomography
Computed tomography (CT) is another imaging modality used
in Alzheimer’s diagnosis, but less frequently than MRI (339). 

[CHUNK 15138]
CT
scans provide detailed cross-sectional brain images and can help
rule out other pathologies that may mimic AD symptoms. 

[CHUNK 15139]
CT
scans can reveal structural abnormalities in the brain, such as
ventricular enlargement or cortical atrophy, associated with AD
(339). 

[CHUNK 15140]
CT is often more readily available and quicker to perform
than MRI, making it useful in speciﬁc clinical situations when
MRI is contraindicated (336).

changes are associated with focal atrophy in the medial temporal
lobe region, including the hippocampus, reﬂecting the typical
progression of neuropathology, which can be assessed in vivo using
MRI (339, 340). 

[CHUNK 15144]
Many studies have evaluated the diagnostic value
of hippocampal atrophy for AD using MRI, with overall sensitivity
and speciﬁcity estimated to be 85 and 88%, respectively (341).


[CHUNK 15145]
10.3 Positron emission tomography
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful imaging
technique that provides functional information about the brain’s
metabolic and molecular processes. 

[CHUNK 15146]
PET scans detect speciﬁc
hallmarks of AD pathology, such as the accumulation of amyloid
plaque and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau neuroﬁbrillary
tangles, as well as changes in glucose metabolism (342, 343).


[CHUNK 15147]
Amyloid plaques are deposits of beta-amyloid protein that
accumulate between nerve cells, while neuroﬁbrillary tangles
are twisted tau protein ﬁbers that build up inside nerve cells
(344). 

[CHUNK 15148]
Although imaging techniques cannot directly visualize
neuroﬁbrillary tangles, they can infer their presence by detecting
associated brain atrophy and functional abnormalities (345). 

[CHUNK 15149]
As
amyloid-targeting therapeutics emerge in the treatment of AD,
amyloid PET scans are being used to determine patients’ eligibility
for clinical trials and to assess treatment outcomes. 

[CHUNK 15150]
Three Amyloid-
β radiotracers, namely 18F-ﬂorbetaben, 18F-ﬂorbetapir, and 18F-
ﬂutemetamol, are currently approved by the FDA for use in
clinical practice (346). 

[CHUNK 15151]
Moreover, the development of numerous
second-generation tau PET tracers with enhanced binding
properties has been achieved. 

[CHUNK 15152]
These tracers include [18F]MK6240,
[18F]PM-PBB3, [18F]RO948, [18F]PI-2620, [18F]JNJ311, and
[18F]Genentech Tau Probe 1 (GTP1) (347, 348). 

[CHUNK 15153]
Each of these
radiotracers has its own set of procedural guidelines and acceptable
interpretation techniques, but they all share the fundamental
property of binding to white matter, not gray matter. 

[CHUNK 15154]
Accordingly,
abnormal scans will demonstrate evidence of diminished gray-
white diﬀerentiation, outward radiotracer extension from the white
matter to the cortical surface, or increased radiotracer uptake by
gray matter compared to white matter (349). 

[CHUNK 15155]
In addition, the
FDA has authorized the use of the 18F-ﬂortaucipir radiotracer to
visualize the distribution and density of NFTs in patients with
cognitive impairment who are being assessed for AD. 

[CHUNK 15156]
Since changes
in tau PET binding are correlated with cognitive symptoms, this
radiotracer provides value not only for diagnosing AD but also
for tracking the spatiotemporal progression of tau pathology in
longitudinal investigations (350).


[CHUNK 15157]
Additionally, PET measures glucose metabolism, allowing
clinicians to assess brain function and detect regions with reduced
metabolic activity, which is indicative of Alzheimer’s-related
neuronal dysfunction (342, 351). 

[CHUNK 15158]
PET can be used to study brain
metabolism and visualize glucose metabolism using the metabolic
tracer 18F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) (352, 353). 

[CHUNK 15159]
PET scans with
FDG or other radiotracers provide insights into regional changes in
cerebral blood ﬂow and glucose metabolism, highlighting areas of
reduced neuronal activity (352, 353). 

[CHUNK 15160]
In AD, hypometabolism in the
temporal, parietal, and posterior cingular regions distinguishes AD
patients from controls with good discriminatory power (354, 355).


[CHUNK 15161]
Recent studies show that amyloid PET brain imaging is highly
sensitive and speciﬁc for neuropathologically conﬁrmed AD, while
FDG PET is highly sensitive and moderately speciﬁc (356).


[CHUNK 15162]
In conclusion, MRI and CT scans reveal progressive brain
atrophy, especially in regions associated with memory and
cognition. 

[CHUNK 15163]
PET imaging, using multiradiopharmaceutical agents,
identiﬁes the presence and distribution of amyloid plaques and
intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau neuroﬁbrillary tangles in
the brain. 

[CHUNK 15164]
As our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease advances,
imaging techniques are expected to become increasingly reﬁned,
providing more accurate and informative insights into this
devastating condition.

[CHUNK 15167]
These pharmacological
agents are indicated for individuals with mild to moderate
Alzheimer’s manifestations (357). 

[CHUNK 15168]
Previous research indicates
that cholinesterase inhibitors engage with cholinergic receptors,
inﬂuence sodium and potassium ion channels, and impact
neurotransmitters’ uptake, synthesis, and release. 

[CHUNK 15169]
In essence,
cholinesterase inhibitors exhibit multiple mechanisms of action,
which could be beneﬁcial when addressing intricate conditions like
AD (358).


[CHUNK 15170]
11.1.2 Types of cholinesterase inhibitors
11.1.2.1 Donepezil (Aricept)
Donepezil is the ﬁrst-line medication for AD. 

[CHUNK 15171]
There are several
RCT studies on the eﬀectiveness of Donepezil on AD. 

[CHUNK 15172]
A meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials in which ﬁve RCTs with
2,974 patients were conducted showed that high-dose donepezil
signiﬁcantly improved cognitive function compared to standard-
dose donepezil. 

[CHUNK 15173]
The overall incidence of adverse events between
the various doses was not observed; However, high-dose donepezil
increased the risk of heart-related issues. 

[CHUNK 15174]
In conclusion, while
high-dose donepezil enhances cognitive function in moderate-
to-severe AD patients, caution is advised for those with heart
conditions (359).


[CHUNK 15175]
A study by Xuemei Zhang assessed the eﬀectiveness and safety
of donepezil in treating patients with mild cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 15176]
Analyzing 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and ﬁve non-
randomized controlled trials (CCTs), encompassing 2,847 patients
revealed that donepezil signiﬁcantly improved MMSE and MoCA
scores. 

[CHUNK 15177]
However, it didn’t notably delay disease progression; the
evidence quality was generally low. 

[CHUNK 15178]
Concerning safety, donepezil
increases the risk of side eﬀects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

[CHUNK 15182]
A meta-analysis study by Kazufumi Yoshida was conducted
to develop a personalized prediction model for AD based on
individual characteristics. 

[CHUNK 15183]
A comprehensive study of 8 randomized
trials with 3,156 participants trials compared the oral donepezil
vs. 

[CHUNK 15184]
placebo. 

[CHUNK 15185]
It was revealed that donepezil is rather eﬃcacious for
cognitive function for most patients in contracts with placebo;
however, using antipsychotic drugs at the study’s onset might
reduce donepezil’s eﬀectiveness. 

[CHUNK 15186]
Despite the drug’s potential
beneﬁts, larger studies with more variables and extended durations
are essential (361).


[CHUNK 15187]
11.1.2.2 Rivastigmine (Exelon)
New drugs were developed during the late 20th century to
control the progression of AD. 

[CHUNK 15188]
Rivastigmine, introduced in 1985
and approved by the FDA in 1997, is used to treat mild to moderate
dementia in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s patients (362). 

[CHUNK 15189]
Recent
research suggests rivastigmine also enhances gait stability, reducing
fall risks for those with Parkinson’s (363).


[CHUNK 15190]
In a study by Jacqueline S Birks, 13 trials, ranging from
12 to 52 weeks, studied the eﬃcacy of either orally (6–12
mg/day) or transdermally (9.5 mg/day) administered medication
with a placebo. 

[CHUNK 15191]
This analysis used data from seven trials
encompassing
3,450
patients.


[CHUNK 15192]
After
26
weeks,
patients on
rivastigmine demonstrated improved cognitive function, daily
living activities, and a better clinician’s global impression, with
three trials showing no diﬀerence from the placebo. 

[CHUNK 15193]
In conclusion;
Rivastigmine beneﬁts individuals with mild to moderate AD.


[CHUNK 15194]
Compared to a placebo, it showed a slower decline in cognitive
function and daily activities, although the improvements were
minimal, and their clinical signiﬁcance is uncertain. 

[CHUNK 15195]
Rivastigmine
also positively impacted clinician’s global assessments. 

[CHUNK 15196]
However,
there was no noticeable diﬀerence in behavior changes. 

[CHUNK 15197]
The studies’
quality of evidence is moderate, with potential biases due to
participant dropouts, and all research was industry-sponsored.

Galanthus nivalis, was identiﬁed in the 1950s. 

[CHUNK 15200]
Initially explored
for neuropathic and paralytic conditions, its potential shifted after
discovering its ability to inhibit acetylcholine esterase. 

[CHUNK 15201]
While it was
considered for various psychiatric treatments, its development for
AD began only in the 1990s because of extraction and synthesis
challenges. 

[CHUNK 15202]
By 2001, the FDA approved it for treating mild to
moderate AD (365–367).


[CHUNK 15203]
In a Meta-analysis study by Deqi Jiang, the eﬀectiveness
and safety of galantamine in treating AD are evaluated By
analyzing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of galantamine for
AD published until April 30, 2014, it found that 8–28 weeks
of galantamine treatment (16–40 mg daily) led to signiﬁcant
improvements in several cognitive and behavioral assessment
scales. 

[CHUNK 15204]
A signiﬁcant downside was that more adverse events
and treatment dropouts were reported in the galantamine group
compared to the placebo group. 

[CHUNK 15205]
Overall, while galantamine
improved cognitive, behavioral, and global functions in AD
patients, its use in clinical treatment should be approached with
caution due to potential side eﬀects (368).


[CHUNK 15206]
11.1.2.4 Tacrine (Cognex)
Tacrine (Cognex) was the ﬁrst drug approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat AD and it received
approval in 1993 (369). 

[CHUNK 15207]
Tacrine’s function as a drug-enhancing
cognition is multifaceted and not fully comprehended. 

[CHUNK 15208]
It acts on
various pathways, including cholinergic, gabaergic, nitrinergic, and
glutamatergic. 

[CHUNK 15209]
Tacrine’s eﬀect on NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is
more related to AD treatment, and its impact on glutamatergic
neurons is direct (as an NMDAR antagonist) and indirect patterns
and inhibits Ca2+-activated potassium channels. 

[CHUNK 15210]
This prevents
membrane repolarization, extends NMDAR activation, and leads
to long-term potentiation. 

[CHUNK 15211]
Therefore, tacrine-derivatives modulate
both cholinesterase and NMDARs (370).


[CHUNK 15212]
Tacrine can help improve cognition and function in some
people with Alzheimer’s, but its eﬀect is modest. 

[CHUNK 15213]
Like other
treatments for Alzheimer’s, it does not cure the disease but can help
manage some of its symptoms. 

[CHUNK 15214]
In 1998, in a meta-analysis study
which is published in JAMA In from 12 trials with 1984 Alzheimer’s
patients, the use of Tacrine (a cholinesterase inhibitor) for 12 weeks
improved cognitive performance, and there was a minor positive
diﬀerence in the behavioral non-cognitive aspects (371).


[CHUNK 15215]
They concluded that using Tacrine may slow cognitive decline
in Alzheimer’s patients in the initial 3 months and heighten the
chances of overall clinical improvement. 

[CHUNK 15216]
Still, unfortunately, the
use of Tacrine was limited due to its side eﬀects, particularly
liver toxicity (372). 

[CHUNK 15217]
Because of the liver toxicity concerns and the
subsequent approval of other cholinesterase inhibitors that had
more favorable side eﬀect proﬁles, the use of Tacrine diminished
over time. 

[CHUNK 15218]
In summary, while Tacrine played a pivotal role in the
history of AD treatments, it is not widely used today due to its side
eﬀect proﬁle.


[CHUNK 15219]
The clinical eﬀectiveness of combining an acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor (AChEI) with Memantine for Alzheimer’s patients
remains unclear when compared to the use of either treatment
alone. 

[CHUNK 15220]
To address this, a systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, focusing on
patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 15221]
From the nine
RCTs (involving 2,604 patients) reviewed, results indicated that
short-term combination therapy had a more signiﬁcant positive
eﬀect on cognition than AChEI monotherapy. 

[CHUNK 15222]
However, there is a
lack of evidence regarding the long-term eﬀects and comparison
with memantine monotherapy (62).


[CHUNK 15223]
11.2 NMDA receptor antagonists in
Alzheimer’s disease
11.2.1 Mechanism of action of NMDA Receptor
Antagonists
Synapse dysfunction caused by amyloid beta (Aβ) is an initial
occurrence in the development of AD. 

[CHUNK 15224]
Prior research indicates
that abnormalities in the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
may play a role in this pathology. 

[CHUNK 15225]
Notably, Aβ peptides have been
shown to aﬀect NMDAR expression and function negatively (373).

Saﬁri et al.


[CHUNK 15228]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
NMDA receptors play a signiﬁcant role in AD because they mediate
calcium inﬂux and maintain calcium homeostasis in the brain.


[CHUNK 15229]
Calcium dysregulation is considered a common mechanism in AD,
and hyperactivity of NMDA receptors has been reported in the
disease (374).


[CHUNK 15230]
NMDA receptor activation is linked to synaptic dysfunction
in AD. 

[CHUNK 15231]
While synaptic NMDARs are protective, overactivation
of NMDARs outside the synapse can lead to cell death. 

[CHUNK 15232]
NMDA
receptor dysfunction, involving pre- and postsynaptic neurons
and glial cells, directly aﬀects AD (375). 

[CHUNK 15233]
Memantine, the most
popular NMDA receptor antagonist, blocks excessive NMDA
receptor activity without disrupting regular activity, providing
neuroprotection and alleviating symptoms in AD patients (376).


[CHUNK 15234]
Memantine performs this by blocking the NMDA glutamate
receptors, helping to regulate the glutamatergic system and
improve cognitive and memory issues. 

[CHUNK 15235]
Memantine’s eﬀectiveness
relies on its unique binding to the NMDAR, where its low aﬃnity
and quick dissociation from the receptor channel ensures the
receptor’s normal function, making the drug well-tolerated with a
minimal side eﬀect proﬁle (377).


[CHUNK 15236]
11.2.2 NMDA receptor antagonists types
11.2.2.1 Memantine
Memantine is the most well-known NMDA receptor antagonist
approved for treating moderate to severe AD. 

[CHUNK 15237]
The European
Federation of Neurological Societies- European Neurological
Society/European
Academy
of
Neurology
(EFNS-ENS/EAN)
conducted a study aimed to determine whether a combination
of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) and Memantine should be
recommended over ChEI alone for patients with moderate to
severe AD to improve cognition, behavior, and daily activities.


[CHUNK 15238]
This determination, conducted based on a systematic review and
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials sourced from the
Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s register
enrolled 1,549 AD patients, indicated that the combination therapy
had signiﬁcant beneﬁts compared to ChEI monotherapy. 

[CHUNK 15239]
Also,
it was mentioned that the strength of evidence varied for each
parameter, with high quality for behavior, moderate for cognitive
function, and low for activities of daily living (378). 

[CHUNK 15240]
So, although
the combination of ChEI and Memantine is suggested over the
use of ChEI alone for patients with moderate to severe AD, this
recommendation is given with a weak endorsement (378).


[CHUNK 15241]
The use of Memantine as an NMDA receptor antagonist
in combination with one of the three common cholinesterase
inhibitors—donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine—has been
studied for the treatment of AD for several years (379). 

[CHUNK 15242]
A meta-
analysis of 54 trials on the combination therapy of Memantine
and Donepezil revealed that the combination of Memantine and
donepezil demonstrated improved outcomes in cognitive function,
daily function, and neuropsychiatric manifestations compared to
monotherapy and placebo. 

[CHUNK 15243]
But it has less acceptability among the
patients. 

[CHUNK 15244]
Combination therapy could be more economically viable,
as Memantine slows the progression of AD.


[CHUNK 15245]
In a study of Japanese patients in 2018, In a meta-analysis
of multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies involving 633
Japanese patients with moderate to severe AD, the eﬃcacy
of Memantine (20 mg/day) proved. 

[CHUNK 15246]
Statistically, a signiﬁcantly
reduced likelihood of clinical worsening across multiple rating
scales compared to a placebo was concluded. 

[CHUNK 15247]
There was a notably
diminished risk of severe deterioration in the memantine group. 

[CHUNK 15248]
It
was also concluded that Memantine oﬀers a promising treatment
solution for AD patients, addressing not just cognitive challenges
but also encompassing a wide array of symptoms, particularly the
behavioral and psychological manifestations of dementia (380)
An updated systematic review and meta-analysis study
evaluated Memantine’s potential as an antidepressant for major
mental disorders. 

[CHUNK 15249]
Eleven double-blind RCTs containing 899
patients showed that Memantine signiﬁcantly decreased depressive
symptoms, especially in patients with mood disorders. 

[CHUNK 15250]
Memantine
appears to be an eﬀective, well-tolerated treatment for depressive
symptoms, particularly in mood disorder patients (381).


[CHUNK 15251]
As mentioned, Memantine is approved by FDA for moderate
to severe AD and its does not have FDA approval for mild
cognitive impairment. 

[CHUNK 15252]
Observational data from nearly 10,000
participants across 44 trials evaluated the beneﬁts of Memantine for
diﬀerent types of dementia. 

[CHUNK 15253]
The majority of trials focused on AD.


[CHUNK 15254]
For those with moderate-to-severe AD, high-certainty evidence
demonstrated that Memantine consistently oﬀered clinical beneﬁts
in areas such as clinical global rating (CGR), cognitive function
(CF), daily living activities (ADL), and behavior and mood
(BM). 

[CHUNK 15255]
However, in mild AD cases, evidence indicated that
Memantine might not be more beneﬁcial than a placebo in most
categories (382).


[CHUNK 15256]
For vascular dementia, there is a probable small clinical beneﬁt
in cognitive function and behavior, but not in other metrics. 

[CHUNK 15257]
While
limited data exists for diﬀerent dementia types, Memantine does
not substantially diﬀer from placebos in causing adverse events.


[CHUNK 15258]
Yet, it’s more likely than a placebo to cause dizziness and possibly
headaches but shows no diﬀerence in fall risks (382). 

[CHUNK 15259]
Memantine
has a small clinical beneﬁt to individuals with moderate-to-severe
AD, regardless of their concurrent use of a ChEI. 

[CHUNK 15260]
However, it
doesn’t provide any notable advantage to those with mild AD.


[CHUNK 15261]
Due to the varied clinical manifestations of AD, it’s improbable
that a single drug will produce signiﬁcant eﬀects. 

[CHUNK 15262]
Current evidence
doesn’t support the early use of Memantine in mild AD, even
though it’s a prevalent approach and extended trials are required
to determine Memantine’s long-term eﬃcacy (382).


[CHUNK 15263]
In the study by Taro Kishi on randomized trial studies,
including 11 memantine vs. 

[CHUNK 15264]
placebo and 17 memantine and
cholinesterase inhibitors combination (M+ChEIs) vs. 

[CHUNK 15265]
ChEIs,
consisting of 7,567 patients evaluated, it was revealed Memantine
alone showed signiﬁcant improvements in Cognitive function and
behavioral disturbances compared to a placebo. 

[CHUNK 15266]
In an analysis of
patients with moderate-severe AD, Memantine improved better in
reducing behavioral disturbances than placebo. 

[CHUNK 15267]
Also, it was shown
that Memantine was combined with ChEIs, with more reduction in
behavioral disorders and improved Cognitive function compared
to ChEIs alone. 

[CHUNK 15268]
Also, they demonstrated no notable diﬀerences in
discontinuation rates among the groups (383).


[CHUNK 15269]
In the safety and eﬀectiveness analysis of cholinesterase
inhibitors and Memantine for AD, which was conducted on 41
randomized controlled trials, it was demonstrated that for mild
to moderate AD, Galantamine 32 mg/day with mean diﬀerence
of −0.51 (CI: −0.67 to −0.35), Galantamine 24 mg/day: with

−0.50 (CI: −0.61 to −0.40) and Donepezil 10 mg/day with −0.40
(CI: −0.51 to −0.29) had the best outcomes in improvement of
cognition compared to placebo. 

[CHUNK 15272]
Among the patients with moderate
to severe AD, a combination of memantine 20 mg and donepezil
10 mg is recommended, with a value of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.11).


[CHUNK 15273]
It was also demonstrated that none of these medications improved
neuropsychiatric symptoms (384).


[CHUNK 15274]
Despite the extensive use of Memantine, there are also
some adverse ﬁndings about its eﬀects on AD. 

[CHUNK 15275]
A meta-
analysis was conducted in 2018 and published in the JAMA
network to demonstrate the association of concomitant use of
cholinesterase inhibitors or Memantine with cognitive decline
in AD. 

[CHUNK 15276]
They used a Meta-database of the Alzheimer Disease
Cooperative Study and Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
and 10 clinical trial studies with a pooled population of 2,714
enrolled. 

[CHUNK 15277]
It was demonstrated that numerous participants who
are administered ChEIs or Memantine often exhibit increased
cognitive deterioration. 

[CHUNK 15278]
This variance is almost equivalent to the
anticipated eﬀect sizes of the treatments examined in these studies.


[CHUNK 15279]
When designing clinical trials for potential AD treatments, the
simultaneous use of ChEIs or Memantine, which may interfere with
ADAS-cog results, should be considered. 

[CHUNK 15280]
Any subsequent analyses
that categorize based on ChEIs or memantine usage should be
cautiously approached due to possible confounding factors (385).


[CHUNK 15281]
This medication received FDA approval for the treatment of
moderate to severe Alzheimer’s dementia (386); however, it also has
non-FDA and label uses for Mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia
and mild cognitive impairment (387). 

[CHUNK 15282]
It is also used for neuropathic
pain (388) and has subscriptions for neuropsychiatric disorders
other than dementia-like bipolar disorder, major depressive
disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (389, 390) and
autism spectrum disorder (391). 

[CHUNK 15283]
Recent studies revealed the
potential therapeutic beneﬁts of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor antagonists, including the antidementia drug memantine.


[CHUNK 15284]
In a self-controlled cohort study using US administrative claims
databases of the 312,336 patients exposed to Memantine, 60
outcomes were identiﬁed other than dementia and memory
loss, which were categorized into ﬁve groups, including mental
disorders, substance use disorders, gastrointestinal and colon
disorders, pain and demyelinating disease. 

[CHUNK 15285]
These ﬁndings indicate
that NMDA receptor antagonists might possess a wider range of
therapeutic applications than previously understood (392).


[CHUNK 15286]
In the study by Shinji Matsunaga, the eﬀect of Memantine
on Lewy body dementia is investigated. 

[CHUNK 15287]
It was revealed that
Memantine wasn’t beneﬁcial in treating cognitive and motor
symptoms of Lewy body disorders. 

[CHUNK 15288]
However, when assessing the
overall impression of the disorders, Memantine might be more
eﬀective than a placebo. 

[CHUNK 15289]
Additionally, Memantine is well-accepted
by patients (393).


[CHUNK 15290]
11.2.2.2 Ketamine (Ketalar)
Ketamin is a water- and lipid-soluble agent for anesthesia, and
its eﬀects come from interactions with various receptors, including
the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). 

[CHUNK 15291]
The liver metabolizes it, which
can induce bronchodilation and stimulate the cardiovascular
system. 

[CHUNK 15292]
Clinically, ketamine is used for various stages of anesthesia,
and it’s termed “dissociative anesthesia” (394).


[CHUNK 15293]
The antidepressant properties of ketamine were discovered
unintentionally. 

[CHUNK 15294]
Additionally, ketamine has fewer side eﬀects in
animals and humans. 

[CHUNK 15295]
Studies have also shown that ketamine
could be beneﬁcial in treating other neurological disorders, such
as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. 

[CHUNK 15296]
This article
discusses the potential of ketamine as a preventive or treatment
option for various neurological conditions (395).

Depression is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like
AD. 

[CHUNK 15298]
Traditional antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), show varying results in treating
depression linked with AD. 

[CHUNK 15299]
A recent analysis of 25 studies on
fourteen antidepressant drugs found limited eﬃcacy in alleviating
AD symptoms. 

[CHUNK 15300]
However, ketamine, a broad-spectrum NMDA
receptor antagonist, has numerous beneﬁts, including treating
depression and its severe manifestations. 

[CHUNK 15301]
Esketamine, a nasal spray
variant of ketamine, was approved by the FDA in 2019 for persistent
depression.

Current research indicates ketamine might protect
brain functions and reduce AD-associated symptoms (395).

11.2.2.3 Dextromethorphan
The FDA approved Dextromethorphan as a cough suppressant
in 1958. 

[CHUNK 15304]
For the last half-century, it has been a prevalent ingredient
in many over-the-counter cough remedies (396), but recently, new
therapeutic indications have been revealed for Dextromethorphan.


[CHUNK 15305]
Neurodegenerative
disorders,
such
as
Alzheimer’s,
are
associated with chronic inﬂammation in the central nervous
system, especially in Microglia and astrocytes. 

[CHUNK 15306]
Diminishing this
inﬂammation could reduce neuronal loss, a hypothesis backed
by ﬁndings that regular use of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) correlates with reduced neurodegenerative disease
rates. 

[CHUNK 15307]
However, NSAIDs might not be strong enough to combat
established neuroinﬂammation. 

[CHUNK 15308]
Dextromethorphan and other
compounds have shown promise in lowering such inﬂammation,
as they inhibit neurotoxicity caused by human microglia and
astrocytes (397, 398). 

[CHUNK 15309]
The medication also received approval
for pseudobulbar aﬀect (PBA), a condition characterized by
unsuitable or heightened emotional reactions that frequently occur
in adults with neurological disorders like amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, traumatic brain
injuries and AD, or Parkinson’s disease (399–401). 

[CHUNK 15310]
A combination
of dextromethorphan hydrobromide and the antidepressant
bupropion hydrochloride is used to treat major depressive disorder

11.3 Antidepressants in Alzheimer’s disease
11.3.1 Mechanism of antidepressant (SSRI)
Although antidepressants are primarily used to treat mood
disorders, recent studies suggest they could also help manage
neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD patients, such as depression
and agitation (403). 

[CHUNK 15313]
However, research results on the connection
between depression and AD have been mixed, and few studies
have been conducted to guide physicians in selecting antidepressant
medication for depression in patients with dementia (404–406).

limited, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most
studied and well-tolerated antidepressants, which are preferred
over other antidepressant medications (404–406). 

[CHUNK 15317]
SSRIs increase
serotonergic activity in the brain by decreasing the activity of the
presynaptic serotonin reuptake pump by nearly 90% (407).


[CHUNK 15318]
APOE ε4 carrier status has been associated with depression
symptoms and higher cortisol levels, which can lead to a decrease
in hippocampal volume (408). 

[CHUNK 15319]
Depression may contribute to AD
through the HPA axis, and current investigations are exploring
its possible role as a risk factor or prodromal symptom of AD.


[CHUNK 15320]
Antidepressants diminish or counteract the risk of eventual AD
outcomes (408). 

[CHUNK 15321]
Antidepressants have been found to provide
neuroprotective beneﬁts for people with depression, improving
cognitive function and long-term memory by increasing 5-HT
levels (409). 

[CHUNK 15322]
Additionally, antidepressants can delay the onset
of AD by aﬀecting neurotransmitter balance and inﬂammatory
pathways (409). 

[CHUNK 15323]
They can also improve mood and reduce
depression and anxiety symptoms commonly experienced by AD
patients, enhancing overall quality of life (410).


[CHUNK 15324]
Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
(SNRIs), such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Eﬀexor),
are antidepressants that inﬂuence serotonin and norepinephrine
levels in the brain (411). 

[CHUNK 15325]
These neurotransmitters play a crucial role
in regulating mood and can help alleviate depressive symptoms in
AD patients.


[CHUNK 15326]
The diagnosis of depression in patients with dementia
and
impaired
cognition
presents
complexities
due
to
the
potential for dementia to exhibit signs and symptoms resembling
depression, even in the absence of the condition, as well
as the ability of depression itself to mimic dementia in the
absence of the latter (405, 412). 

[CHUNK 15327]
In challenging circumstances,
a treatment trial with antidepressant medication may be the
only feasible diagnostic technique (405). 

[CHUNK 15328]
Despite the limited
availability of reliable diagnostic tools to diagnose depression in
individuals with dementia (405, 413), the American Association
for Geriatric Psychiatry has established diagnostic criteria for this
condition (414).


[CHUNK 15329]
11.3.2 Dosage and administration of
antidepressant
Although the choice of an SSRI is typically based on the
side eﬀect proﬁle, medication interactions, and cost, the most
commonly prescribed medications are citalopram and sertraline
(405). 

[CHUNK 15330]
Citalopram, with a starting daily dose of 5–10 mg and a
maximum daily dose of 20 mg every morning or every evening, is
recommended to reduce the risk of QT-prolongation in patients
aged over 65 years old (405, 406). 

[CHUNK 15331]
Sertraline with a starting
daily dose of 12.5–25 mg and a maximum daily dose of 25–
200 mg daily is suggested (405, 406). 

[CHUNK 15332]
Fluoxetine is less desirable
in older adults due to its long half-life and drug interactions,
and Paroxetine’s eﬀects on cognition due to its anticholinergic
impacts (405). 

[CHUNK 15333]
Other types of antidepressant medication, such
as serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine) and
noradrenergic antagonists (mirtazapine), have not been well-
studied, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) are not recommended
due to cardiovascular and nervous system side eﬀects (405, 406).


[CHUNK 15334]
It should be noted that a physician should closely monitor the
use of antidepressant medications in AD because these medications
may require dose adjustments, have negative side eﬀects, and
interact with other medications the patient may be taking.


[CHUNK 15335]
11.3.3 Psychotherapy
In addition, clinicians should consider psychotherapy as an
eﬀective treatment for patients with mild to moderate dementia,
including Multimodal CBT, Psychodynamic, interpersonal therapy,
and Multifaceted and semi-tailored intervention (405, 415), which
is underutilized in practice.

for AD. 

[CHUNK 15338]
These antagonists are critical for synaptic plasticity and
transmission (416). 

[CHUNK 15339]
Excessive activation of glutamate receptors,
particularly the NMDA type, can lead to excitotoxic eﬀects on
neurons and is thought to contribute to neurodegeneration.


[CHUNK 15340]
Synaptic dysfunction in AD may be attributed to atypical
activation of the NMDA receptor. 

[CHUNK 15341]
The NMDA receptor antagonist
memantine is especially eﬀective in blocking the receptor and
reducing the inﬂux of calcium (Ca2+) ions into neurons,
thereby preventing toxic intracellular events from occurring (416).


[CHUNK 15342]
Memantine may slow cognitive decline by reducing excitotoxicity
and promoting neuroplasticity through modulation of glutamate
transmission (417). 

[CHUNK 15343]
In AD, acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter
that is signiﬁcantly depleted. 

[CHUNK 15344]
Some antidepressants, like trazodone,
have anticholinergic properties, which can be useful for managing
agitation and behavioral symptoms in AD patients by modulating
the cholinergic system (418).


[CHUNK 15345]
11.4.1 Types of anxiolytics
11.4.1.1 Benzodiazepines
Lorazepam (Ativan) and alprazolam (Xanax) are types of
anxiolytic medications known as benzodiazepines, which act on
GABA-A receptors in the brain (419). 

[CHUNK 15346]
Although benzodiazepines
are frequently prescribed for anxiety and sleep conditions, their
usage in AD is a matter of debate owing to the potential
risks involved (420, 421). 

[CHUNK 15347]
Clinicians typically avoid administering
benzodiazepines to older people with dementia as these drugs cause
confusion and slow down mental processes. 

[CHUNK 15348]
It is recommended
to be cautious when using benzodiazepines in AD and consider
alternative treatment options. 

[CHUNK 15349]
While they are not typically the ﬁrst
choice for managing anxiety in AD due to their potential to cause
sedation, confusion, and an increased risk of falls, they may be
considered in some cases when other options are ineﬀective (422).


[CHUNK 15350]
11.4.1.2 Buspirone (Buspar)
Buspirone is a partial agonist at serotonin receptors (5-HT1A)
and is classiﬁed as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic (423). 

[CHUNK 15351]
Earlier
evidence indicates that buspirone may be an eﬀective non-sedating
option for managing anxiety symptoms in patients with AD (424).

Buspirone is a useful treatment for managing behavioral issues in
individuals with dementia (425).


[CHUNK 15355]
11.4.1.3 Hydroxyzine (Vistaril)
Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine that has sedative properties
and can be used to manage anxiety in AD patients. 

[CHUNK 15356]
It has been found
to be just as eﬀective as other anxiolytic agents like benzodiazepines
and buspirone, and is well-tolerated (426). 

[CHUNK 15357]
However, it may
cause sleepiness or drowsiness more frequently than the other
medications (426). 

[CHUNK 15358]
It’s important to be careful when taking
hydroxyzine because it can cause drowsiness and anticholinergic
side eﬀects, which could worsen cognitive decline (427).


[CHUNK 15359]
11.4.1.4 Gabapentin (Neurontin)
Gabapentin is not a ﬁrst-line treatment for anxiety in AD,
but it may be considered in cases where other options have
failed (428). 

[CHUNK 15360]
The mechanism of action of gabapentin to alleviate
anxiety is not clear, but it is believed to regulate the release of
neurotransmitters. 

[CHUNK 15361]
By binding to the α2-δ subunit of voltage-gated
calcium channels, gabapentin may hinder neuronal signaling in
the central nervous system, leading to a reduction in the release
of excitatory neurotransmitters and a decrease in anxiety (429).


[CHUNK 15362]
Additionally, gabapentin may reduce the formation of excitatory
neuronal synapses, ultimately resulting in a decrease in overall
neuronal activity and anxiety (430). 

[CHUNK 15363]
Gabapentin may also raise
the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory
neurotransmitter that can help reduce anxiety (429).


[CHUNK 15364]
11.5 Monoclonal antibodies
11.5.1 Aducanumab
Aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid
β (Aβ) aggregates, was the ﬁrst drug approved by the FDA
in June 2021 for address the underlying biology of Alzheimer’s
disease. 

[CHUNK 15365]
It is approved for treating patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI-AD) or those in the mild dementia stage. 

[CHUNK 15366]
This
approval, granted through the accelerated pathway, was based
on aducanumab’s ability to clear Aβ plaques, despite no direct
evidence linking plaque removal to reduced cognitive or functional
decline. 

[CHUNK 15367]
Aducanumab is a IgG1 antibody with high aﬃnity for
a speciﬁc conformational epitope on both soluble oligomers and
insoluble ﬁbrils of β-amyloid, a key protein involved in Alzheimer’s
disease (431–434).


[CHUNK 15368]
The decision to approve aducanumab sparked signiﬁcant
controversy, as results from the Phase 3 trials (EMERGE and
ENGAGE) were conﬂicting, and post-hoc analyses failed to
deﬁnitively prove eﬃcacy. 

[CHUNK 15369]
Concerns were also raised about
the drug’s high cost, safety proﬁle, and potential to slow
further progress in Alzheimer’s research. 

[CHUNK 15370]
The European Medicines
Agency’s rejection of aducanumab in December 2021 added to the
controversy. 

[CHUNK 15371]
Biogen is currently conducting a conﬁrmatory study,
ENVISION, which is expected to be completed by 2026 (432–434).


[CHUNK 15372]
11.5.2 Lecanemab
Lecanemab, an FDA-approved antibody targeting amyloid beta
(Aβ), is used to treat early Alzheimer’s disease by binding to
soluble Aβ protoﬁbrils, which are more toxic to neurons than
monomers or insoluble ﬁbrils. 

[CHUNK 15373]
The Clarity AD study, an 18-month
multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with an open-
label extension, evaluated lecanemab’s safety and eﬃcacy (435, 436).


[CHUNK 15374]
Lecanemab received approval based on the Clarity phase 3 trial,
which showed reductions in amyloid plaque burden and cognitive
decline. 

[CHUNK 15375]
However, three signiﬁcant concerns warrant caution before
the widespread adoption of the medication: the limited magnitude
of its beneﬁcial eﬀects, the considerable risks associated with its
use, and its potentially unprecedented costs. 

[CHUNK 15376]
Although lecanemab
demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant impact on cognition, the
eﬀect size was minimal and may lack clinical signiﬁcance, falling
below independent estimates of the minimally important clinical
diﬀerence. 

[CHUNK 15377]
This suggests that the cognitive improvements may be
imperceptible to most patients and caregivers (437).


[CHUNK 15378]
11.5.3 Donanemab
Donanemab is a humanized antibody targeting the reduction
of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. 

[CHUNK 15379]
A
randomized clinical trial assessed the eﬃcacy and adverse events
associated with donanemab, a monoclonal antibody designed to
clear brain amyloid plaques, in early symptomatic Alzheimer’s
disease. 

[CHUNK 15380]
Conducted across 277 medical research centers in eight
countries, this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-
month phase 3 trial enrolled 1,736 participants diagnosed with mild
cognitive impairment or mild dementia who exhibited amyloid and
low/medium or high tau pathology based on positron emission
tomography imaging. 

[CHUNK 15381]
The results indicated a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
in the integrated Alzheimer Disease Rating Scale score at 76
weeks, with the donanemab group showing a mean change of−6.02
compared to−9.27 in the placebo group for the low/medium
tau population, and −10.19 vs. 

[CHUNK 15382]
−13.11 in the combined study
population. 

[CHUNK 15383]
These ﬁndings demonstrate that donanemab treatment
signiﬁcantly slowed clinical progression in these patients (438).


[CHUNK 15384]
A systematic review analyzes four studies involving 396 adult
patients treated with Donanemab compared to a placebo or
standard care (228 vs. 

[CHUNK 15385]
168 participants). 

[CHUNK 15386]
The results indicated
that Aβ-plaque reduction was inﬂuenced by baseline levels,
with complete amyloid clearance observed in those with lower
baseline levels (<24.1 Centiloids). 

[CHUNK 15387]
The treatment also slowed
tau accumulation and led to a 32% reduction in cognitive and
functional decline. 

[CHUNK 15388]
However, safety concerns were raised due to
Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), which occurred
in 26.1–30.5% of participants across trials. 

[CHUNK 15389]
While preliminary
evidence suggesting that Donanemab may delay cognitive and
functional decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, it
remains uncertain whether it provides signiﬁcant therapeutic
beneﬁts that alter the clinical status of these patients (439). 

[CHUNK 15390]
Further
research is needed to investigate the relationship between Aβ-
plaque reduction and tau toxicity in achieving meaningful clinical
outcomes for AD patients experiencing cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 15391]
Finally, evidence suggests that the eﬀectiveness of both
Donanemab and Lecanemab diminishes as disease severity
increases. 

[CHUNK 15392]
In Phase 3 trials, patients with lower amyloid burdens
at baseline experienced greater overall treatment beneﬁts, while
those with higher amyloid burdens showed less improvement.


[CHUNK 15393]
Ongoing studies, such as the AHEAD study (NCT04468659) and
TRAILBLAZER-3 (NCT05026866), are now investigating these

12 Non-pharmacological
management strategies
Beyond pharmaceutical interventions, a variety of non-
pharmacological
strategies,
including
cognitive
stimulation
therapy, reality orientation therapy, music therapy, physical
exercise, and occupational therapy, have demonstrated comparable
eﬃcacy and may be used as complementary to them.


[CHUNK 15397]
Cognitive stimulation encompasses activities and discussions
such as reminiscence therapy and reality orientation therapy, which
are as eﬀective as cholinesterase inhibitors in mitigating cognitive
decline and have become standard practice for patients with
mild-to-moderate dementia (440, 441). 

[CHUNK 15398]
The primary purpose of
cognitive stimulation therapy is to retain and develop the cognitive
capacities of those with dementia, therefore reducing the disease’s
progression. 

[CHUNK 15399]
It promotes and maintains mental capacities, social
interactions, personal autonomy and self-esteem, control of stress
and abnormal psychological reactions, cognitive and functional
performance, daily living activities, and the overall quality of life for
patients and caregivers (442). 

[CHUNK 15400]
Studies on the eﬃcacy of cognition
stimulation therapy for AD have yielded contradictory results. 

[CHUNK 15401]
Still,
a systematic review of these studies found that this intervention
model preserved the cognitive performance of patients with mild-
moderate AD regarding reasoning, constructive praxis, and word
list recognition. 

[CHUNK 15402]
In contrast, the control group deteriorated in these
functions over 6 months (442).


[CHUNK 15403]
Reality orientation therapy is an intervention for individuals
with amnesic impairments, confusion episodes, and spatial-
temporal disorientation, which are common among patients
with dementia, especially AD patients. 

[CHUNK 15404]
The primary goal of
reality orientation therapy is to reorient patients with their
history, surroundings, and time through repeated multimodal
stimulations. 

[CHUNK 15405]
It employs both formal and informal modes of
operation, with formal reality orientation therapy carried out
in small groups of cognitively impaired individuals, giving
scheduled interactions for around 45 min every day, with
promising outcomes in the treatment of dementia (443). 

[CHUNK 15406]
Reality
orientation
therapy
has
been
demonstrated
to
supplement
pharmaceutical
therapies
for
AD.


[CHUNK 15407]
For
example,
an
RCT
on patients with Alzheimer’s showed that 6-month reality
orientation therapy combined with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
could signiﬁcantly improve cognitive outcomes compared to
administering acetylcholinesterase inhibitors alone (444).


[CHUNK 15408]
Music therapy is another non-pharmacologic treatment option
for AD that can be used to distract patients, assist them in coping
with emotional and aﬀective issues, and encourage them to live
longer while mitigating behavioral and psychological symptoms of
dementia by making it easier for them to recall episodic memories,
even if the music is unrelated to the memories they are recalling
(445, 446). 

[CHUNK 15409]
MEAMs (music-evoked autobiographical memories)
can be sparked by a musical cue. 

[CHUNK 15410]
They can reveal knowledge about
one’s past, which may be exceptionally vivid, incredibly thorough,
and spontaneously remembered, as well as evoke robust emotional
responses (447). 

[CHUNK 15411]
Music-evoked emotions have been discovered to
colocalize in the anterior hippocampus with MEAMs, underlying
the facilitation of memory recall by music (448). 

[CHUNK 15412]
In this way, several
RCTs were launched to evaluate the eﬃcacy of music therapy
for AD. 

[CHUNK 15413]
According to a trial, music, particularly active musical
therapy through singing, could eﬀectively enhance both immediate
and delayed memory and language abilities in mild patients and
psychiatric symptoms in moderate or severe patients; however,
the eﬀects did not last longer than 3 months (449). 

[CHUNK 15414]
Although
mechanisms behind the therapeutic beneﬁts of music therapy
in AD have remained elusive, several studies have established
that these mechanisms involve stimulation of neurogenesis and
neuroplasticity, enhancement of dopamine release, and immune
system modulation (446).


[CHUNK 15415]
Physical exercise has also been shown in multiple RCT and non-
RCT trials to improve cognition function, activities of daily living,
neuropsychiatric symptoms, and physical function in AD patients.


[CHUNK 15416]
In addition, when compared to pharmaceutical therapies such
as cholinesterase inhibitors, physical exercise has demonstrated
higher eﬃcacy and adherence (450).


[CHUNK 15417]
Adding occupational therapy to routine clinical care can
signiﬁcantly enhance patient care by providing caregivers with
guidance on compensatory and environmental strategies for
managing patients’ cognitive decline (451). 

[CHUNK 15418]
This approach reduces
caregiving stress and empowers patients by improving their coping
techniques, ultimately minimizing their dependency. 

[CHUNK 15419]
Speciﬁcally
for individuals with dementia, this therapeutic process involves
assisting them in identifying personally meaningful activities,
streamlining their implementation to maximize engagement, and
creating an environment free from stressors and distractions
(452). 

[CHUNK 15420]
Several home-based occupational interventions have been
developed, including a tailored activity program (TAP), the
environmental skill-building program (ESP), and advancing
caregiver training (ACT). 

[CHUNK 15421]
Brieﬂy, ESP oﬀers patients tailored
activities to their capabilities while educating caregivers to
generalize these activities to new settings, which are advantageous
in lowering caregiver strain and being cost-eﬀective (453, 454).


[CHUNK 15422]
On the other hand, ESP incorporates strategies to modify the
home environment’s physical, social, and task aspects (455).


[CHUNK 15423]
Additionally, the ACT approach involves creating an action plan
for patients that includes particular behaviors, goal-setting triggers,
and management strategies. 

[CHUNK 15424]
At the same time, caregivers receive
training in stress management, self-care strategies, and hands-
on training for daily living activities (456). 

[CHUNK 15425]
Dance and yoga,
gardening, mealtime activities, montessori programs, and animal-
assisted therapy are among occupation-based therapies that have
shown positive eﬀects. 

[CHUNK 15426]
These therapies target diﬀerent sensory
systems while providing meaningful and social engagement (457).


[CHUNK 15427]
Occupational therapists can use these interventions to boost
patients’ engagement and beneﬁts, but further research on their
eﬃcacy and delivery by skilled professionals will be required.

with patients to evaluate and change various aspects of their
lifestyle to avoid, manage, and reverse chronic disease (458).


[CHUNK 15431]
Several lifestyle changes have been proven advantageous in AD
management, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, good
sleep hygiene, socialization and engagement with hobbies, and
stress management.


[CHUNK 15432]
Multiple healthy diet patterns have been identiﬁed to aﬀect
the disease course in patients with AD. 

[CHUNK 15433]
Some studies have
shown the beneﬁcial eﬀects of the Mediterranean diet, unsaturated
fats, vitamins, polyphenols, trehalose, and cocoa and cocoa-
derived products on AD prevention and management (458, 459).


[CHUNK 15434]
Although many nutrients have been shown to be implicated in
neuroprotection at the cellular and molecular levels and even to
signiﬁcantly lower the risk of AD development in populations,
it can be challenging to recommend a precise diet for patients
with AD as the metabolism of many nutrients is disrupted
by the disease (459). 

[CHUNK 15435]
For example, epidemiological and clinical
studies have shown that adequate intake of omega-3 fatty acids
can be advantageous for the prevention of AD, but when the
neuropathological state progresses, it is unable to maintain or
ameliorate the condition (460, 461). 

[CHUNK 15436]
Multiple clinical studies, on the
other hand, have shown that a ketogenic diet for patients with AD
can signiﬁcantly improve activities of daily living, quality of life, and
cognitive measures (462–464).


[CHUNK 15437]
Multiple studies have also found that regular physical activity
has a considerably favorable eﬀect on symptom relief in patients
with AD by inhibiting multiple neuroinﬂammatory pathways
implicated in disease pathogenesis (465, 466). 

[CHUNK 15438]
Similarly, a recent
systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 RCTs on patients with
AD or associated dementia of varied forms and severity found
that physical activity might considerably enhance and prevent the
decline in executive function (467). 

[CHUNK 15439]
Another systematic review and
meta-analysis of 15 RCTs on AD patients demonstrated that aerobic
exercise of 30 min per session, <150 min per week, and up to three
times per week can signiﬁcantly improve cognitive function, as
measured by the MMSE score, with the most signiﬁcant impact in
patients with poorer basal cognitive status (468).


[CHUNK 15440]
Circadian dysfunction is closely linked to AD pathology,
with sleep disturbances playing a signiﬁcant role in impaired
neuroplasticity and enhanced neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 15441]
Aβ and tau
pathology interact with circadian rhythms, contributing to sleep
system dysfunction (469, 470). 

[CHUNK 15442]
Thus, good sleep hygiene, which
may be improved by encouraging regular physical activity and
adhering to a regular wake-sleep cycle, limiting naps during the day,
and not being exposed to light and noise at night, is an essential step
forward in the management of AD (470).


[CHUNK 15443]
Given
the
well-established
beneﬁts
of
socializing
in
neuroplasticity,
investigations
on
patients
with
AD
have
yielded promising results. 

[CHUNK 15444]
This approach revealed that mild-
to-moderate AD patients who participated in socialization
procedures for more than two semesters exhibited no year-to-
year loss in several indicators of cognitive performance (471).


[CHUNK 15445]
Moreover, socialization strategies can potentially improve quality
of life, cognitive stimulation, and emotional wellbeing. 

[CHUNK 15446]
Social
interaction and participation in hobbies aid in the maintenance
of language abilities, the reduction of behavioral problems, and
the postponement of cognitive decline (472). 

[CHUNK 15447]
Improved quality
of life is aided by family support, peer engagement, and social
activities. 

[CHUNK 15448]
Furthermore, spirituality and religion function as coping
techniques and can improve general wellbeing in patients with
AD (472).


[CHUNK 15449]
The motor and cognitive malfunctions seen in AD patients
not only cause stress but also have the potential to disrupt the
brain circuits responsible for managing stress responses. 

[CHUNK 15450]
Chronic
stress in AD patients stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis and increases corticotropin release, resulting in oxidative
stress and toxicity of β-amyloid peptide, which has neurotoxic
eﬀects on the hippocampus. 

[CHUNK 15451]
These eﬀects ultimately impact
cognition and contribute to the progression of AD, highlighting
the signiﬁcance of stress management in these patients (473). 

[CHUNK 15452]
Stress
management entails coping methods that incorporate both physical
and emotional changes. 

[CHUNK 15453]
Coping comes in two diﬀerent forms:
problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. 

[CHUNK 15454]
Individuals
employing emotion-focused coping strive to alleviate the negative
emotions triggered by stress without necessarily altering the
challenging environment (474). 

[CHUNK 15455]
Engaging in preferred hobbies,
exercising, resting, seeking social support, self-indulgent escapism,
seeking distance, negative avoidance, and adapting to stress can all
fall under this category (475). 

[CHUNK 15456]
On the other hand, problem-focused
coping involves actively handling stressful situations through
problem-solving, daily activity planning, convincing oneself of the
patient’s impairment, and distracting oneself (475, 476).


[CHUNK 15457]
14 Future directions in Alzheimer’s
disease treatment and management
Regardless of the numerous studies, at this moment, there is no
deﬁnite treatment option for AD (477, 478). 

[CHUNK 15458]
Non-pharmacological
therapies like exercise therapy, music therapy, light therapy,
massage therapy, and cognitive training have been investigated
and none of them makes a great diﬀerence in AD signs and
symptoms (479–485).


[CHUNK 15459]
In spite of all that, scientists are still looking for a new treatment
strategy hoping to ﬁnd an eﬃcient one. 

[CHUNK 15460]
Current research aims the
therapeutic approaches to slow or stop the progression of AD. 

[CHUNK 15461]
They
consider every aspect of the disease, like biology and diagnostic
markers, to help them design clinical trials and ﬁnd the eﬀective
treatment (486, 487).

anti-tau antibodies—semorinemab (495), gosuranemab (496), and

This includes BIIB080, an
investigational therapy and an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)
targeting tau expression. 

[CHUNK 15473]
In a phase 1 randomized clinical trial,
BIIB080 was evaluated in AD patients and was found to reduce tau
biomarkers. 

[CHUNK 15474]
The eﬀects of this agent are being further evaluated in
phase 2 trials (498). 

[CHUNK 15475]
Another new agent under study is trontinemab,
a bispeciﬁc modular fusion protein composed of gantenerumab and
a human transferrin receptor, which aids in crossing the blood-
brain barrier. 

[CHUNK 15476]
This agent is still being studied for potential use in
clinical trials (499).


[CHUNK 15477]
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and plasma exchange are
two other treatment options which have been studied but not
shown as promising results as mAbs (500, 501).


[CHUNK 15478]
14.2 Gene therapy
Gene therapy uses diﬀerent strategies and targets speciﬁc
regions of the brain in order to treat AD, for example, acting
directly on amyloid precursor protein, increase neuroprotection,
boosting autophagy-mediated pathways, targeting inﬂammatory
pathways, and modulating genes related to lipid metabolism (502).


[CHUNK 15479]
Most of these strategies exhibit positive results in improving
cognition in animal models. 

[CHUNK 15480]
However clinical studies have shown
inconclusive results mostly related to delivery methods used in gene
therapy (503). 

[CHUNK 15481]
Gene therapy has shown a great potential for treating
AD, but for now clinical results are not ready to be relied on and it
needs more evaluations in order to be used in AD treatment.


[CHUNK 15482]
14.3 Stem cell therapy
The majority of stem cells used in AD therapy include neural
stem cell (NSC), mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), embryonic stem
cell (ESC), and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) (504). 

[CHUNK 15483]
NSC
has been studied on cellular level and animal models (505–512).


[CHUNK 15484]
Generally, NSC therapy appears to be more eﬀective in early
stage of AD. 

[CHUNK 15485]
MSC therapy is studied the most and has entered
clinical levels (513). 

[CHUNK 15486]
It uses diﬀerent mechanisms in the brain and
ultimately can improve cognition (514). 

[CHUNK 15487]
ESC is studied in animal
models and higher memory ability was achieved as the result (515).


[CHUNK 15488]
In the past few years iPSC is the most studied stem cell in clinical
levels and has shown some promising results, but there is a risk
for infection and tumorigenicity which indicates the need for more
investigations (516, 517). 

[CHUNK 15489]
Overall, stem cell therapy has shown
to be a promising treatment for AD in the future, but for now
it needs a lot more investigations specially in clinical levels to
become available.


[CHUNK 15490]
14.4 Digital therapeutics
Digital therapeutics (DTx) is an emerging ﬁeld that provides
evidence-based therapeutic interventions via internet and software,
employing tools such as mobile devices, computers, videogames,
apps, sensors, and virtual reality. 

[CHUNK 15491]
DTx is used as an adjunctive
therapy in AD for improving memory, cognition, functional
abilities, and managing motor symptoms (518).


[CHUNK 15492]
15 Challenges and considerations in
Alzheimer’s disease treatment and
management
Longitudinal population studies have provided evidence of a
decline in the incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRD) in high-income countries when
adjusted for age. 

[CHUNK 15493]
However, the overall number of patients with
ADRD continues to rise due to the aging population (519,
520).This reduction has been attributed to improved management
of modiﬁable risk factors like cardiovascular health and higher
levels of education. 

[CHUNK 15494]
These ﬁndings highlight the role of modiﬁable
risk factors in the development of AD and emphasize the need for
ongoing eﬀorts in primary prevention within the ﬁeld of dementia
management (521).


[CHUNK 15495]
Several studies consistently demonstrate an increased risk
of dementia and AD associated with vascular and metabolic
risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, midlife
obesity, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. 

[CHUNK 15496]
Hypertension, in
particular, is a treatable risk factor for ADRD (522). 

[CHUNK 15497]
However,
the relationship between blood pressure and ADRD is complex.


[CHUNK 15498]
Midlife hypertension (deﬁned as BP ≥140/90 mm Hg between
40 and 65 years of age) has been consistently linked to an
elevated risk of ADRD in longitudinal studies. 

[CHUNK 15499]
The Honolulu-
Asia Aging Study, which examined a 3,703 Japanese American
men cohort, was the ﬁrst to report this association. 

[CHUNK 15500]
High systolic
blood pressure (≥160 mm Hg) was associated with an increased
risk of dementia in the untreated group (OR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.0–11.8).


[CHUNK 15501]
Subsequent population studies have conﬁrmed this ﬁnding (523).


[CHUNK 15502]
The relationship between hypercholesterolemia and AD risk is less
clear and likely multifaceted (524). 

[CHUNK 15503]
Similar to other vascular risk
factors, this association may be partially explained by survival bias
and competing mortality associated with elevated cholesterol due
to premature cardiovascular death. 

[CHUNK 15504]
However, there have also been
reports indicating that unintentional decreases in cholesterol levels
in late life may signify an elevated risk of AD and related dementias,
rather than serving as a protective factor (525).


[CHUNK 15505]
Diabetes is considered a lifelong risk factor for ADRD,
including both juvenile type 1 and adult-onset type 2 diabetes, and
is associated with a 1.5- to 2.5-fold increased risk of ADRD [41].


[CHUNK 15506]
AD and diabetes mellitus share common features such as increased
prevalence after the age of 65, signiﬁcant impact on quality of
life, and increased healthcare costs. 

[CHUNK 15507]
The Rotterdam Study, which
followed a population-based cohort of 6,370 elderly individuals
(≥55 years of age), found that the presence of diabetes nearly
doubled the risk of AD (526).


[CHUNK 15508]
Midlife obesity, deﬁned as a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2
between the ages of 35 and 64 years, aﬀects over 10% of adults in
the Western world. 

[CHUNK 15509]
The relationship between midlife obesity and
AD risk is well-documented, with studies consistently reporting an
increased risk of ADRD associated with obesity during this period
(527). 

[CHUNK 15510]
Numerous epidemiologic studies have demonstrated a link
between midlife body mass index (BMI) and the risk of developing

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) later in life,
independent of other vascular or socioeconomic risk factors. 

[CHUNK 15513]
These
ﬁndings highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy BMI
throughout adulthood. 

[CHUNK 15514]
Additionally, epidemiological studies have
conﬁrmed that smoking is a risk factor for ADRD (528). 

[CHUNK 15515]
The
Rotterdam Study, a population-based follow-up study involving
6,870 individuals aged 55 years and older, investigated the impact
of smoking on ADRD risk. 

[CHUNK 15516]
After an average follow-up of 2.1 years,
the study concluded that smokers had a higher risk of developing
AD (relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3–4.1) (529).


[CHUNK 15517]
Diagnosing AD promptly allows for earlier intervention,
but the stigma associated with the diagnosis, coupled with
the
lack
of
eﬀective
therapeutic
options,
can
discourage
individuals from seeking help. 

[CHUNK 15518]
Social stigma surrounding an
AD diagnosis is prevalent in certain societies and cultures, further
discouraging patients from reporting early symptoms to their
general practitioners and delaying early intervention or support.


[CHUNK 15519]
Psychological complications, particularly in the years following
a dementia diagnosis, may contribute to an increased risk of
suicide (530). 

[CHUNK 15520]
Another signiﬁcant issue is the lack of awareness
among patients, their families, and general practitioners regarding
dementia and its symptoms. 

[CHUNK 15521]
Patients often dismiss dementia
symptoms as a normal part of aging and therefore do not disclose
them to their doctors. 

[CHUNK 15522]
Some general practitioners also struggle
to diﬀerentiate between cognitive impairment and normal aging.


[CHUNK 15523]
This normalization of symptoms leads to delays in seeking help.


[CHUNK 15524]
Patients and general practitioners often prioritize physical health
over mental health, which may result in the dismissal of dementia
symptoms. 

[CHUNK 15525]
In addition to directly impacting the patient, a diagnosis
of dementia has a negative impact on families and caregivers (531).


[CHUNK 15526]
When AD is suspected, it is crucial to conduct thorough
testing to rule out other conditions that may have similar signs
and symptoms, especially since some of these conditions may
be reversible. 

[CHUNK 15527]
More extensive testing is necessary to minimize
false positive and false negative results. 

[CHUNK 15528]
In the middle and
later stages of AD, ethical dilemmas arise regarding balancing
patient autonomy with the need to protect them. 

[CHUNK 15529]
Caregivers
may face challenges regarding whether they should inﬂuence the
patient without disclosing their intentions, withhold information
to prevent distress, or even resort to lying to avoid causing
psychological stress, particularly during the advanced stages of the
disease. 

[CHUNK 15530]
As AD patients approach the end of life, questions arise
regarding the extent to which extraordinary measures should be
taken to prolong their lives. 

[CHUNK 15531]
As the patient’s condition deteriorates
and their existence becomes highly burdensome, some argue that
it may be more humane to allow natural death, even in the
absence of available beneﬁcial treatments. 

[CHUNK 15532]
Psychiatrists should
provide patients who desire access to information about their
condition, even when eﬀective treatments are unavailable, as long
as the information has meaningful prognostic implications (532).


[CHUNK 15533]
A meta-analysis by Martyr et al. 

[CHUNK 15534]
identiﬁed several factors associated
with better quality of life (QoL) in AD patients. 

[CHUNK 15535]
These factors
include a positive relationship with the caregiver, religious beliefs
or spirituality, and active social engagement. 

[CHUNK 15536]
Other important
factors included functional ability, self-rated health and awareness,
receiving care in a specialized dementia unit or living with a spouse,
and being of white race. 

[CHUNK 15537]
Demographic factors were found to have
minimal impact on QoL. 

[CHUNK 15538]
On the other hand, neuropsychiatric
symptoms such as depression were strongly associated with
poorer QoL. 

[CHUNK 15539]
Additionally, poorer QoL was linked to more severe
dementia, other medical conditions, pain and anxiety, unmet needs,
and living alone (533). 

[CHUNK 15540]
Studies examining diﬀerent severity stages of
dementia consistently show that patients with moderate-to-severe
or severe dementia incur higher societal costs compared to those
with mild or moderate dementia. 

[CHUNK 15541]
The diﬀerence in costs between
severity groups was statistically signiﬁcant in all studies where
signiﬁcance was reported (533).


[CHUNK 15542]
16 Caregiving for Alzheimer’s patients
16.1 Caregiving for Alzheimer’s patients
As previously mentioned, caregivers play a crucial role in
detecting early changes in a patient’s cognitive abilities and can
signiﬁcantly contribute to the early diagnosis of individuals with
AD. 

[CHUNK 15543]
Therefore, it is propose that mHealth applications designed to
support caregivers should incorporate a category of AD diagnosis
tests. 

[CHUNK 15544]
This functionality should encompass various cognitive
dimensions and track the progression of cognitive impairment over
time. 

[CHUNK 15545]
This feature allows caregivers to administer cognitive tests to
identify early signs of cognitive decline and share the results with
physicians to facilitate personalized treatment options (534).


[CHUNK 15546]
Spouses and adult children who care for family members with
AD often experience ﬁve distinct phases of caregiving throughout
the course of the disease. 

[CHUNK 15547]
These phases involve monitoring
initial symptoms, navigating the diagnosis process, assisting with
instrumental and basic activities of daily living, and preparing for
the future. 

[CHUNK 15548]
Although it is evident that involving AD caregivers
in the patient’s care management is beneﬁcial, they are frequently
excluded from the care team or undervalued in their role. 

[CHUNK 15549]
Many
caregivers desire active involvement in decision-making processes
related to AD care, ranging from diagnosis to treatment (535, 536).


[CHUNK 15550]
Considering that AD is characterized by progressive cognitive
decline, the information that caregivers can provide is notable.


[CHUNK 15551]
They can advocate for the patients and oﬀer insights that no
other healthcare professional within the care team can provide.


[CHUNK 15552]
Additionally, caregivers often neglect their own needs while
providing care, leading to a higher likelihood of having multiple
chronic conditions. 

[CHUNK 15553]
For instance, studies have shown that 35%
of caregivers aged 45–64 and 53% of those over 65 have two or
more chronic conditions. 

[CHUNK 15554]
Individuals with chronic conditions may
face limitations due to their own illness, making it increasingly
challenging to provide care as the disease progresses and requiring
more extensive self-care (537, 538).


[CHUNK 15555]
Incorporating
caregivers
as
valuable
assets
within
the
healthcare team model can signiﬁcantly enhance the quality of
care provided. 

[CHUNK 15556]
Previous reviews of dementia knowledge training
for caregivers have demonstrated that such education generally
leads to improved caregiver outcomes. 

[CHUNK 15557]
However, most of these
reviews have focused on training content, such as attitudes, beliefs,
conﬁdence, perceived competence, and self-eﬃcacy. 

[CHUNK 15558]
Additionally,
these reviews have primarily assessed the eﬀectiveness and
outcomes of interventions rather than focusing on the evaluation
instruments utilized in the programs. 

[CHUNK 15559]
To address this, Burgio
and colleagues recommended using standardized and recognized
Frontiers in Medicine

[CHUNK 15560]
Saﬁri et al.


[CHUNK 15561]
10.3389/fmed.2024.1474043
tools to prevent biased results and enhance the methodological
rigor of studies. 

[CHUNK 15562]
A previous systematic review of ﬁve validated
instruments
for
evaluating
dementia
knowledge
identiﬁed
several limitations, including weak psychometric properties,
outdatedness, and limited scope. 

[CHUNK 15563]
Therefore, there is a clear
need to understand further dementia knowledge instruments
developed by the authors and previously published to improve
their eﬀectiveness and applicability. 

[CHUNK 15564]
When individuals with
dementia experience communication diﬃculties, it becomes
increasingly challenging for them to participate socially and engage
in interactions. 

[CHUNK 15565]
This can lead to social isolation and hinder their
ability to maintain relationships and contribute to society (539).


[CHUNK 15566]
Recognizing the importance of addressing both the cognitive and
social consequences of dementia, the INTERDEM Social Health
Taskforce and the European Working Group of People with
Dementia (EWGPWD) emphasize the need to prioritize social
health for this population (540).


[CHUNK 15567]
One
approach
to
improving
communication
between
caregivers and individuals with dementia is through caregiver
communication enhancement education and training techniques.


[CHUNK 15568]
One example of such a program is “FOCUSED” (541). 

[CHUNK 15569]
FOCUSED
is a structured program that aims to provide caregivers with
information
about
AD
and
communication,
correct
any
misconceptions about communicating with individuals diagnosed
with the disease, and oﬀer techniques to maximize communication
potential (542). 

[CHUNK 15570]
Various strategies are recommended, including
using closed-ended or choice-based questions instead of open-
ended ones, using direct and straightforward phrases, repeating
key words and ideas, noting changes in conversation topics,
employing direct contacts such as touch and eye contact, and
utilizing comments and non-verbal cues to maintain the quality
and ﬂow of conversation (543, 544).


[CHUNK 15571]
Other similar programs incorporate additional strategies,
such as providing positive feedback when individuals with
dementia follow through on requests, allowing suﬃcient time
to respond to questions or requests, and engaging them in
conversations about their lives and interests. 

[CHUNK 15572]
Caregivers are
also advised to provide speciﬁc instructions rather than general
ones, use one-step instructions, and oﬀer positive comments to
the person with dementia (545). 

[CHUNK 15573]
Furthermore, some programs
teach caregivers personalized strategies to enhance communication
with speciﬁc individuals with AD. 

[CHUNK 15574]
These approaches rely on
“conversation analysis”, which helps caregivers identify eﬀective
and ineﬀective conversation techniques and utilize the participants’
strengths to improve their interactions. 

[CHUNK 15575]
Additionally, activity-
based interventions to increase communication can be conducted
individually or in groups, incorporating speciﬁc activities (e.g.,
meal preparation) or various activities to stimulate communication.


[CHUNK 15576]
These groups typically focus on improving or maintaining
functional skills, with communication being a central aspect (545,
546).


[CHUNK 15577]
16.2 Self-care for caregivers
As discussed in the previous part, caregivers of Alzheimer’s
patients face many challenges. 

[CHUNK 15578]
For maintaining physical and mental
health, engaging in self-care strategies is crucial. 

[CHUNK 15579]
It has been shown
that self-care practices for professional caregivers have reduced
occupational stress and increased resilience, a critical skill one
acquires to bounce back from diﬃculties and stress at work
(547). 

[CHUNK 15580]
In addition to lowering burnout, distress, and diminished
competence, self-care provides a positive and supportive work
environment (548).


[CHUNK 15581]
Also,
there
are
many
informal
caregivers
(ICGS)
for
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). 

[CHUNK 15582]
In contrast
to non-caregiving populations, ADRD ICGs practice less self-care
(549), and stress and burden have been associated with less eﬀective
self-care (550, 551). 

[CHUNK 15583]
Also, as a recent study showed, ICGs demand
not only personal needs like maintaining their physical and mental
health; providing enough information, awareness, and insight are
also critical components that should be provided (552). 

[CHUNK 15584]
In this
article, we mention some important points of self-caring for both
ICGs and formal caregivers in individualized institutions.


[CHUNK 15585]
For caretakers, self-care must include both exercise and a
balanced diet. 

[CHUNK 15586]
Physical exercise could enhance mood, lessen stress,
and increase general wellbeing (553). 

[CHUNK 15587]
In addition, a balanced diet
full of fresh produce, including vegetables and fruits, lean meats,
and whole grains, may oﬀer careers the nutrients they need to
promote their wellbeing (554).


[CHUNK 15588]
Caregivers may beneﬁt from mindfulness and relaxation
practices to reduce stress and improve their psychological
wellbeing. 

[CHUNK 15589]
According to studies, mindfulness techniques like deep
breathing exercises and meditation aid in reducing symptoms of
stress, depression, and anxiety. 

[CHUNK 15590]
Regularly practicing mindfulness
may assist caregivers in developing a feeling of peace and enhance
their capacity to deal with the diﬃculties of caring (555, 556).


[CHUNK 15591]
Caregivers should take time for themselves and partake in
activities they like. 

[CHUNK 15592]
Maintaining personal interests and hobbies is
imperative. 

[CHUNK 15593]
According to a study, satisfying activities may lower
stress levels and enhance general wellbeing (557). 

[CHUNK 15594]
Caregivers should
recharge and keep a sense of identity apart from their caring
position by taking breaks from their duties and making time for
personal interests (558).


[CHUNK 15595]
Social engagement and receiving social support are other
examples of self-care demands. 

[CHUNK 15596]
Studies of mostly female ADRD
ICGs showed that support networks are crucial for stress
management, sharing responsibilities and caring tasks, advocating
for self-care, validating ICGs’ needs for self-care, and oﬀering self-
care advocacy (559–563). 

[CHUNK 15597]
Another study on ADRD ICGs showed
that engaging in spiritual and religious activities like attending
churches and praying provides them courage and emotional
support (561, 564, 565).


[CHUNK 15598]
In summary, self-care practices are essential to minimize
adverse health consequences from caring for Alzheimer’s patients
and to achieve optimum health and quality of life outcomes.


[CHUNK 15599]
Caregivers must remember that not only prioritizing self-care
and self-management is not selﬁsh, but it is also a demand for
patients’ health.


[CHUNK 15600]
16.2.1 Legal considerations
Alzheimer’s is an ongoing and disabling disease, so its ﬁnancial
cost is incredible. 

[CHUNK 15601]
Due to that, the legal and ﬁnancial issues involved
in providing care for a person with AD should be understood
by caregivers. 

[CHUNK 15602]
Caregivers may aid patients’ families with ensuring
their loved ones get the care they need by planning and consulting
experts when required (566–569).

A power of attorney document enables a person with dementia
(referred to as the principal) to designate another person (referred
to as an agent or an attorney-in-fact), typically a domestic partner,
spouse, entrusted family member, or friend to handle ﬁnancial and
other decisions on their behalf when they are no longer able. 

[CHUNK 15606]
The
agent should be carefully selected, and it is advised that they have a
lengthy discussion with the principal regarding the duties involved.


[CHUNK 15607]
If the principal is unable or unwilling to serve, a replacement
agent or agents should be decided on. 

[CHUNK 15608]
The agent is tasked with
carrying out the principal’s instructions and acting in the person’s
best interests. 

[CHUNK 15609]
Unlike the principal, a power of attorney does not
give the agent the power to make decisions until the person with
dementia loses mental competence (570).


[CHUNK 15610]
A guardian is chosen by the court to manage a person’s assets
and care. 

[CHUNK 15611]
Guardianship is often considered when a dementia
patient can no longer manage their own care, and either the
family cannot agree on the required care, or there is no family. 

[CHUNK 15612]
A
guardian ensures that the person’s daily requirements for safety,
food, housing, and care are satisﬁed, in addition to making ﬁnancial
and healthcare choices. 

[CHUNK 15613]
The court is ultimately accountable for and
in charge of guardians (571).


[CHUNK 15614]
16.2.2 Insurances
Medicare and Medicaid, the two largest public insurance
programs, provide healthcare services to their beneﬁciaries.


[CHUNK 15615]
Medicare oﬀers services that include hospital insurance (Part A),
outpatient medical insurance (Part B), prescription drug coverage
(Part D), and additional beneﬁts such as vision, hearing, or dental
care (Part C). 

[CHUNK 15616]
Medicaid, a joint federal and state program, provides
free health insurance coverage to low-income children and their
caregivers, pregnant individuals, the elderly, individuals who are
blind, and those with other diabilities who incur high medical
expenses (572, 573).


[CHUNK 15617]
US Public Health Insurance revenue, including the Medicare
Trust Fund, is sourced from payroll taxes, federally allocated
budgets, monthly premiums paid by beneﬁciaries, and interest
earning. 

[CHUNK 15618]
These funds are subsequently divided and allocated
to cover plans from Part A to Part D. Reimbursement fees
paid to healthcare providers constitute a signiﬁcant portion of
total fund disbursement, necessitating careful assessment and
allocation of resources. 

[CHUNK 15619]
Medicare provides reimbursement to
healthcare professionals and encourages them to treat patients
under insurance coverage with high quality care. 

[CHUNK 15620]
This is achieved by
setting a “Fee Schedule” and negotiating with healthcare providers
to prevent excess charges on patients and the healthcare system,
while also supporting the adoption of innovative advancements
(573, 574). 

[CHUNK 15621]
In contrast, inappropriate reimbursement can lead
to devastating consequences, including ﬁnancial losses, time-
consuming investigations conducted by the CMS (Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services) to identify overbilling and fraud,
inequities, and loss of participation in medicare (575).


[CHUNK 15622]
Reimbursement criteria are updated frequently, and insurance
companies adjust their policies based on market trends, changes in
healthcare legislations, advancements in patient therapy guidelines,
and the development of new technologies. 

[CHUNK 15623]

ABSTRACT
Objective  Physical activity (PA) is associated with 
a decreased incidence of dementia, but much of the 
evidence comes from short follow-­ups prone to reverse 
causation. 

[CHUNK 18187]
This meta-­analysis investigates the effect of 
study length on the association.


[CHUNK 18188]
Design  A systematic review and meta-­analysis. 

[CHUNK 18189]
Pooled 
effect sizes, dose–response analysis and funnel plots 
were used to synthesise the results.


[CHUNK 18190]
Data sources  CINAHL (last search 19 October 2021), 
PsycInfo, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (21 October 
2021) and SPORTDiscus (26 October 2021).


[CHUNK 18191]
Eligibility criteria  Studies of adults with a prospective 
follow-­up of at least 1 year, a valid cognitive measure 
or cohort in mid-­life at baseline and an estimate of the 
association between baseline PA and follow-­up all-­cause 
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia were 
included (n=58).


[CHUNK 18192]
Results  PA was associated with a decreased risk of all-­
cause dementia (pooled relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.77 
to 0.84, n=257 983), Alzheimer’s disease (0.86, 95% CI 
0.80 to 0.93, n=128 261) and vascular dementia (0.79, 
95% CI 0.66 to 0.95, n=33 870), even in longer follow-­
ups (≥20 years) for all-­cause dementia and Alzheimer’s 
disease. 

[CHUNK 18193]
Neither baseline age, follow-­up length nor 
study quality significantly moderated the associations. 


[CHUNK 18194]
Dose–response meta-­analyses revealed significant linear, 
spline and quadratic trends within estimates for all-­cause 
dementia incidence, but only a significant spline trend 
for Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 18195]
Funnel plots showed possible 
publication bias for all-­cause dementia and Alzheimer’s 
disease.


[CHUNK 18196]
Conclusion  PA was associated with lower incidence 
of all-­cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, even 
in longer follow-­ups, supporting PA as a modifiable 
protective lifestyle factor, even after reducing the effects 
of reverse causation.


[CHUNK 18197]
INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, around 50 million people suffer from 
dementia. 

[CHUNK 18198]
This number is projected to triple by 
2050, with two-­thirds of these people living in 
low-­income and middle-­income countries.1 The 
economic burden of dementia is estimated to be 
as high as US$818 billion annually,2 thus making 
dementia prevention a health priority in ageing 
societies. 

[CHUNK 18199]
Physical inactivity is one of 12 poten-
tially modifiable risk factors suggested to account 
for about 40% of old-­age dementias.3 Several path-
ways through which physical activity (PA) may 
prevent dementias have been proposed: decreased 
production of β-amyloid, increased removal of 
β-amyloid, improved brain vasculature and blood 
flow, and antioxidative and inflammatory processes 
in the brain,4 as well as indirect pathways through 
improvements in sleep, mood and other cardiovas-
cular risk factors.


[CHUNK 18200]
Meta-­analyses indicate an association between 
PA and decreased risk of all-­cause dementia,5–7 
including in a dose–response manner.8 However, 
many previous meta-­analyses lack rigorous quality 
assessments,7 and the association between PA and 
dementia appears absent when PA is measured 
before the age of 657 8 or in follow-­ups longer 
than 10 years.6 9 As the Alzheimer’s disease process 
starts decades before diagnosis,10 even studies with 
10-­year follow-­ups are likely to include partici-
pants with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 18201]
Thus, 
studies assessing mid-­life PA and old-­age dementia 
diagnoses with a follow-­up of at least 20 years 
are needed to confirm whether PA is a modifiable 
protective lifestyle factor of dementia.


[CHUNK 18202]
This systematic review and meta-­analysis exam-
ines if mid-­life PA is a protective factor of all-­
cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular 
dementia. 

[CHUNK 18203]
We examine separately studies with 
follow-­ups longer than 20 years, high-­quality 
studies and studies with younger cohorts to 
reduce the effect of reverse causality. 

[CHUNK 18204]
Because the 
association of PA and dementia might potentially 
be modified by the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) geno-
type,11–13 education,14 PA type,12 15 sample size16 
and funding source,17 we additionally examine 
these factors as possible moderators of PA–
dementia associations.


[CHUNK 18205]
METHODS
This systematic review and meta-­analysis is reported 
in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-­Analyses statement18 
(see online supplemental material part 1) and was 
registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018083236). 


[CHUNK 18206]
However, due to insufficient data, some registered 
analyses were not conducted and the original regis-
tered plan was adapted (online supplemental mate-
rial part 1).

Review
Eligibility criteria
Types of studies
We included prospective cohort studies and case–control studies 
with a baseline measure of PA and a follow-­up measure of all-­
cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. 

[CHUNK 18210]
Only 
studies with follow-­ups longer than 1 year were included.


[CHUNK 18211]
Types of participants
Participants were adults (≥20 years of age at baseline). 

[CHUNK 18212]
We 
excluded studies where participants had some specific disease at 
baseline or where the cohort had established dementia or mild 
cognitive impairment at baseline. 

[CHUNK 18213]
For populations that were older 
than mid-­life (defined as mean or median age <55 years and 
maximum age <65 years or mean age plus 1 SD <60 years), a 
valid measure of baseline cognition was required to be reported. 


[CHUNK 18214]
This was done to minimise the possibility of including cohorts 
with a prodromal state of dementia and to account for the long 
preclinical period of Alzheimer’s disease10 and the typical age of 
dementia onset.19
Types of exposure
We included studies assessing PA with objective measures or 
questionnaires. 

[CHUNK 18215]
We excluded studies examining single bouts 
of PA, retrospectively reported PA, fitness levels or PA levels 
measured extending over the follow-­up period.


[CHUNK 18216]
Types of outcomes
Studies needed to report the association between PA and all-­
cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia. 


[CHUNK 18217]
We included studies that diagnosed dementia based on valid 
measures of cognition or register data, but excluded studies that 
based dementia diagnosis on cause of death data in more than 
50% of the participants.


[CHUNK 18218]
Types of reports
Full-­text reports in English were included.


[CHUNK 18219]
The decision rules that supplement these inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria are described in online supplemental material part 
1.


[CHUNK 18220]
Search strategy
We conducted a systematic literature search in six electronic 
databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycInfo, SPORTDiscus 
and Web of Science). 

[CHUNK 18221]
Two reviewers conducted searches in all six 
databases, with the last search undertaken on 26 October 2021. 


[CHUNK 18222]
The keywords of the original search included physical activity, 
physically active, sport, athletics, athlete, running, walking, phys-
ical training, dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Alzheimer’s, cogni-
tion, cognitive, executive function, TELE (telephone assessment 
of dementia), TICS (Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status), 
MMSE (Mini-­Mental State Examination), 3-­MS (the Modified 
Mini-­Mental State Examination), memory, processing speed, 
verbal fluency, semantic fluency, reasoning, delayed recall, 
prospective, longitudinal, follow-­up, follow up, observational 
and cohort. 

[CHUNK 18223]
In addition to the search results, individual studies 
known to the authors were added to the meta-­analysis. 

[CHUNK 18224]
Further 
details and example searches are described in the online supple-
mental material part 1.


[CHUNK 18225]
Study selection
Inclusion was based on the assessments of two independent 
reviewers (PI-­M+KW/JP/KK). 

[CHUNK 18226]
Disagreements were discussed, 
and if consensus was not reached, a third independent researcher 
made the inclusion decision (UMK). 

[CHUNK 18227]
Study screening was done 
in two phases: clearly irrelevant studies were excluded in the 
title and abstract phase, and thereafter, full-­text manuscripts 
were reviewed. 

[CHUNK 18228]
In cases where multiple studies reported similar 
outcome data from the same cohort, we only included the study 
with the best quality score, longest follow-­up or largest sample 
size (in this order). 

[CHUNK 18229]
Two studies that we excluded from the main 
meta-­analyses (due to other reports from the same cohort being 
of a higher quality) were however included in the ApoE ɛ4 inter-
action analysis, as the studies included in the main meta-­analyses 
from these same cohorts did not present any ApoE ɛ4 interaction 
analyses.20 21
Quality assessment
We developed a quality assessment tool specifically for this 
systematic review and meta-­analysis to provide high transpar-
ency of the assessment and to account for the precise character-
istics of the addressed study questions (see online supplemental 
material part 1). 

[CHUNK 18230]
The new quality assessment tool assesses and 
scores the representativeness of the exposed cohort, PA assess-
ment methods, demonstration that dementia was not present at

[CHUNK 18231]
We used three existing quality assessment tools to inform the 
development of our quality assessment tool: the Newcastle-­
Ottawa Quality Assessment Form for Cohort Studies,22 the 
performance bias estimator by Shiri and Falah-­Hassani23 and the 
quality assessment tool for quantitative studies from the Effec-
tive Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment.24
Two researchers reviewed the studies with the quality assess-
ment tool independently (PI-­M+KW/JP). 

[CHUNK 18232]
Disagreements were 
resolved with discussion. 

[CHUNK 18233]
If the study cited other papers, at 
maximum three papers were sought for the required informa-
tion. 

[CHUNK 18234]
We used a quality scoring system with three categories 
based on the assumption that studies of high quality have less 
possibility of reverse causation, the study cohort is not selected 
and the measurement of both dementia and PA is valid (good 
quality: ≥2.5+1+≥2.5 stars, moderate quality: ≥2+≥0.5+≥2 
stars, poor quality: not reaching good or moderate quality).


[CHUNK 18235]
Data extraction
The following outcomes and moderator data were extracted 
from the included studies: rates of all-­cause dementia, Alzhei-
mer’s disease and vascular dementia incidence; PA levels; 
estimates of the associations between PA levels and all-­cause 
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia; length 
of follow-­up; sample age and gender make-­up; sample size; 
country of origin; publication year; study design (including a 
twin study or not); work-­related or leisure-­time PA; confounders 
(age, cognition at baseline, chronic diseases, education, gender, 
vascular risk factors, ApoE ɛ4); follow-­up and participation rate; 
gender interaction; stratification of results according to gender; 
ApoE ɛ4 interaction results; results stratified according to ApoE 
ɛ4 allele; number of adjusted confounders; study quality and 
funding (online supplemental material part 2). 

[CHUNK 18236]
Two reviewers 
extracted the estimates of association (PI-­M+KW/JP) and 
follow-­up length (PI-­M+KW). 

[CHUNK 18237]
The likeness of the extractions 
was compared and disagreements were resolved by discussion. 


[CHUNK 18238]
The estimates with the best quality assessment scores and the 
most extensive adjustments were included. 

[CHUNK 18239]
For example, if base-
line cognition was only measured and controlled for in one 
subgroup of the study sample, then data for that subgroup were 
extracted instead of the uncontrolled data from the full sample.

Review
Studies using the WHO PA recommendation25 as the category 
cut-­off were also preferred if many estimates were presented. 


[CHUNK 18243]
The data extraction of moderators other than follow-­up length 
was done by one reviewer (PI-­M).


[CHUNK 18244]
Two researchers (PI-­M and KW) independently assessed 
whether the PA categories and reference categories in each 
study met the WHO PA recommendation.25 Disagreements were 
discussed until consensus was reached.


[CHUNK 18245]
Patient involvement
This meta-­analysis combines data from pre-­existing data sets. 


[CHUNK 18246]
No patients were involved in study design, planning the search 
strategies, planning the quality assessment or sensitivity anal-
yses, implementation of the study, interpretation of the results 
or writing up the results.


[CHUNK 18247]
Statistical analyses
Summary statistics were relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. 

[CHUNK 18248]
For 
studies that did not report RR data, ORs or HRs were converted 
into RRs. 

[CHUNK 18249]
OR data were converted to RRs using the formula 
RR=OR/(1−p0+p0*OR), when the outcome occurred in less 
than 10% of the sample, with p0=outcome incidence in the 
whole study population.26 When the outcome was common 
(>10%), we used the square root transformation of OR as 
recommended by VanderWeele.27 We transformed HRs into RRs 
using the following formula: ‍RR = (1 −e∧(HRxln(1 −r)))/r
‍, where r is the incidence rate of dementia for the reference 
group.28 A separate RR was calculated for each higher PA cate-
gory reported in the included study by comparing each higher 
PA category to the lowest PA level in the study (eg, an inactive or 
reference category).


[CHUNK 18250]
For the main meta-­analyses, we pooled all estimates of the 
relationship between PA and all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s 
disease and vascular dementia, combining categorical and 
continuous measures of PA. 

[CHUNK 18251]
We used a random-­effects model 
with inverse-­variance as the weighting method and estimated 
the statistical heterogeneity with DerSimonian-­Laird method 
(indexed with the I2 value). 

[CHUNK 18252]
We conducted sensitivity analyses to 
examine the impacts of removing the study with largest sample 
size and highest weight on the overall result. 

[CHUNK 18253]
An additional anal-
ysis examined this relationship within high-­quality studies that 
had measured PA in mid-­life and had a follow-­up longer than 
20 years.


[CHUNK 18254]
Meta-­regressions and comparative subgroup analyses exam-
ined the effects of baseline age, follow-­up length and meeting 
the WHO PA recommendation on the association of PA and 
all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia. 


[CHUNK 18255]
Studies for which the reference category exceeded the WHO 
guidelines were excluded from the analysis of meeting the PA 
recommendations.


[CHUNK 18256]
Next, we performed planned sensitivity analyses to examine 
the effects of sample size, PA type (leisure time or both leisure 
time and work related) and other covariates on the relationships 
of PA and all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular 
dementia. 

[CHUNK 18257]
Additionally, we examined the effect of funding 
source (no commercial funding source vs at least one commer-
cial funding source) on the associations. 

[CHUNK 18258]
There were too few 
twin studies and studies addressing gender effects to conduct the 
prespecified sensitivity analyses of these issues. 

[CHUNK 18259]
Finally, we exam-
ined only the highest PA level compared with the lowest PA level 
as has been done in earlier meta-­analyses.5 6 29
Dose–response meta-­analyses were performed to explore 
linear, quadratic and restricted cubic spline trends between PA 
levels and RRs of dementia onset. 

[CHUNK 18260]
These were conducted in R 
with the ‘dosresmeta’ package.30 A full description of the dose–
response methods is available in online supplemental material 
part 3.


[CHUNK 18261]
An additional preplanned sensitivity analysis was performed 
to examine if the presence of ApoE ε4 allele moderates the asso-
ciations between PA and all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease 
and vascular dementia. 

[CHUNK 18262]
Pooled estimates for the association 
of PA and all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular 
dementia were calculated separately for ApoE ε4 carriers and 
non-­carriers, and a significance test compared the results across 
the two subgroups.31
Funnel plots were used to examine the potential publica-
tion bias. 

[CHUNK 18263]
Primary analyses were conducted in Stata V.16.0 
(StataCorp).


[CHUNK 18264]
RESULTS
Database searches identified 16 324 articles, of which 15 658 
were excluded based on title and abstract screening (figure 1). 


[CHUNK 18265]
We assessed 666 full-­text articles, 58 of which reported a study 
that fulfilled the inclusion criteria.9 11 12 15 32–85 Overall, studies 
included 257 983 (range: 67–81 087), 128 261 (range: 300–71 
157) and 33 870 (range: 638–20 639) participants for all-­cause 
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia outcomes, 
respectively.


[CHUNK 18266]
Methodological quality
Methodological quality is reported in online supplemental mate-
rial part 2. 

[CHUNK 18267]
The number of studies of high quality was very low 
(four all-­cause dementia studies,9 40 55 61 three Alzheimer’s disease 
studies9 12 40 and one vascular dementia study).40 Selection, study 
length and follow-­up rate were the most problematic domains of 
study quality, with 62%, 65% and 41% of studies receiving the 
lowest rating on these three quality domains, respectively.


[CHUNK 18268]
PA and all-cause dementia
The mean incidence of all-­cause dementia was 10.9% (total n 
in the analyses=257 983). 

[CHUNK 18269]
When compared with the lowest PA 
category, the pooled RR in higher PA categories showed an asso-
ciation with a reduced risk of all-­cause dementia (RR 0.80, 95% 
CI 0.77 to 0.84) (figure 2, table 1). 

[CHUNK 18270]
Mean follow-­up length was 
12.9 years (SD 9.5), and mean baseline age was 67.0 (SD 12.9) 
years. 

[CHUNK 18271]
There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies 
(I2=68.7%), but neither baseline age, the length of follow-­up 
nor study quality modified the association significantly (table 1). 


[CHUNK 18272]
The result was similar within the 16 studies with at least 20 years 
of follow-­up (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.87, mean baseline age 
50.5 (SD 7.8) years, mean follow-­up 27.6 (SD 5.1) years and 
percentage of participants with dementia at follow-­up 14.6%). 


[CHUNK 18273]
In four high-­quality studies, the pooled RR was 0.82 (95% CI 
0.67 to 0.99), with a mean baseline age of 48.2 (SD 3.5) years 
and mean follow-­up of 23.2 (SD 4.5) years and 7.6% of partic-
ipants with dementia at follow-­up. 

[CHUNK 18274]
This was very similar to the 
pooled RR of 0.80 in all studies (table 1).


[CHUNK 18275]
Only three studies were of high quality, had a young baseline 
age of 30–55 years and had a follow-­up longer than 20 years. 


[CHUNK 18276]
The pooled RR in these studies was also similar to the pooled 
RR in all studies, but not significant (pooled RR 0.79, 95% 
CI 0.62 to 1.01). 

[CHUNK 18277]
Omitting the study with the largest sample 
size or the study with the largest weight did not significantly 
change the result (online supplemental table S1). 

[CHUNK 18278]
Sample size, 
funding source, adjusting for ApoE ε4 status, baseline cognition 
or education did not significantly modify the association of PA

PA and Alzheimer’s disease
The mean incidence of Alzheimer’s disease was 8.3% among 128 
261 participants. 

[CHUNK 18287]
Compared with the lowest PA category, the 
pooled RR in higher PA categories showed an association with 
lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 
to 0.93; online supplemental figure S1 and table 2). 

[CHUNK 18288]
The mean 
follow-­up length was 11.5 (SD 8.8) years, and mean baseline 
age was 68.7 (SD 12.4) years. 

[CHUNK 18289]
There was moderate heteroge-
neity between the studies (I2=47.6%), and neither baseline age, 
the length of follow-­up nor study quality modified the associ-
ation significantly (table 2). 

[CHUNK 18290]
This result was similar among the 
seven studies with at least 20 years of follow-­up (RR 0.76, 95% 
CI 0.64 to 0.90, mean baseline age 52.8 (SD 8.9) years, mean 
follow-­up 26.8 (SD 6.4) years and percentage of participants 
with Alzheimer’s disease at follow-­up 5.2%). 

[CHUNK 18291]
Among the three 
high-­quality studies, the pooled RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.42 to

[CHUNK 18292]
Neither sample size, adjust-

PA and vascular dementia
The mean incidence of vascular dementia was 3.8% among 33 
870 participants. 

[CHUNK 18297]
When compared with the lowest PA category, 
the pooled RR in higher PA categories showed an association

Statistical heterogeneity 
between the studies was moderate (I2=36.0%).


[CHUNK 18300]
Neither baseline age, length of follow-­up, meeting the WHO

DISCUSSION
This meta-­analysis showed that higher PA levels were associ-
ated with lower incidence of all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s 
disease and vascular dementia. 

[CHUNK 18311]
These associations were present 
for all-­cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease in studies with 
long follow-­ups (>20 years) and in cohorts with baseline age 
between 30 and 55 years. 

[CHUNK 18312]
Neither baseline age nor follow-­up 
length moderated the associations of PA with all-­cause dementia 
or Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 18313]
Data for vascular dementia were scarce, 
especially for long follow-­ups, but the results supported an 
inverse association between PA and vascular dementia incidence.


[CHUNK 18314]
Earlier meta-­analyses investigating the associations between 
PA levels and dementia incidence have been based on short 
follow-­ups,5 29 86 and the results have only been significant in 
studies with short (<10 years) follow-­ups6 9 or elderly popula-
tions.7 8 These factors can introduce the possibility of reverse 
causation, whereby PA levels are affected by dementia.9 Partic-
ipants’ levels of PA may also change during long follow-­ups.87 
In this study, we did not find evidence to suggest that reverse 
causation or regression dilution bias88 affected the observed 
associations between PA and dementias. 

[CHUNK 18315]
Our results therefore 
support the role of PA as a modifiable protective mid-­life lifestyle 
factor of dementia. 

[CHUNK 18316]
However, funnel plots for all-­cause dementia 
and Alzheimer’s disease suggested some publication bias.


[CHUNK 18317]
In high-­quality studies, a non-­significant negative association 
was found between PA and Alzheimer’s disease.

Review
a significant association is low to moderate but the pooled 
RR estimate in high-­quality studies (0.71) was similar to that 
obtained when including all studies (0.86). 

[CHUNK 18325]
Additionally, the 
meta-­regression estimate did not show significant moderation 
by study quality. 

[CHUNK 18326]
Our inclusion criteria were also strict, as we 
excluded studies with baseline in old age and without a validated 
measure of cognition at baseline. 

[CHUNK 18327]
This procedure reduces the risk 
of bias due to reverse causality, but led to fewer studies being 
included in the meta-­analysis. 

[CHUNK 18328]
The strict representativeness crite-
rion may have unnecessarily limited the number of high-­quality 
studies88 and thereby increased the CIs of pooled risk estimates 
from high-­quality studies.


[CHUNK 18329]
Dose–response meta-­analyses showed significant linear, 
quadratic and cubic inverse associations between PA levels and 
incidence of all-­cause dementia and vascular dementia. 

[CHUNK 18330]
The 
finding of a linear dose–response is in line with the results from 
Xu et al8; however, in our analysis, the effect of PA on all-­cause 
dementia incidence was greatest when moving from extreme 
sedentariness to some PA. 

[CHUNK 18331]
While a significant cubic spline rela-
tionship was observed between PA and Alzheimer’s disease, the 
model only included two studies that examined the effects of PA 
levels greater than 1750 MET*min/week. 

[CHUNK 18332]
More studies among 
more physically active cohorts are needed to conclusively deter-
mine whether more PAs offer greater protection at the higher 
end of the spectrum, or whether a moderate level of PA offers 
similar protective effects.


[CHUNK 18333]
Our results contrast with those from Kivimäki et al9 who 
examined individual participant data from many study cohorts 
worldwide (n=404 840). 

[CHUNK 18334]
In that study, no associations were found 
between PA and all-­cause dementia or Alzheimer’s disease when 
follow-­ups were longer than 10 years. 

[CHUNK 18335]
Notably, the incidence of 
all-­cause dementia in their meta-­analysis was 0.5%. 

[CHUNK 18336]
This is an 
exceptionally low all-­cause dementia incidence rate, considering 
the global annual dementia incidence rate of 17.3% in adults over 
60 years of age.89 Two factors can explain this. 

[CHUNK 18337]
First, the mean age 
at baseline was 45.5 years in Kivimäki et al.9 As the mean follow-­up 
length was 14.9 years, the mean age at the end of follow-­up was 
approximately 60.4 years, but the mean age of all-­cause dementia 
diagnosis in the study was 80.6 years. 

[CHUNK 18338]
The result was similar in 
a subanalysis of persons aged 60 years or older.9 The follow-­up 
length of over 10 years may also contribute to reverse causation, 
considering the long preclinical period of Alzheimer’s disease.10 
Therefore, these earlier results may be susceptible to bias from 
both early-­onset dementias and reverse causation.


[CHUNK 18339]
The very low all-­cause dementia incidence rate in the Kivimäki 
et al’s9 study may also be explained by the source of incidence 
rate data: the meta-­analysis used register data (hospitalisations, 
medical reimbursements and death registers) and a few very 
large cohorts had only death register data. 

[CHUNK 18340]
We excluded studies 
with dementia mortality as the outcome because the relatively 
low sensitivity of death registers to detect dementia cases may 
underestimate its association with risk or protective factors.90 
Further, dementia mortality in younger individuals is likely to 
reflect early-­onset dementias. 

[CHUNK 18341]
On the other hand, there may be a 
survival bias, whereby those with higher levels of PA live longer 
and are therefore at an increased risk of developing dementia.

Review
The sensitivity analyses for all-­cause dementia and Alzhei-
mer’s disease showed similar estimates among studies that 
controlled for baseline cognition. 

[CHUNK 18349]
Studies have primarily assessed 
baseline cognition using short screening tests, which are known 
to result in ceiling effects, and most studies of younger cohorts 
did not assess cognitive ability at baseline.

Review
collected information on baseline cognition, few adjusted for it 
in their analyses. 

[CHUNK 18361]
Because baseline cognitive ability may be the 
most robust predictor of cognition later in life,91 the absence 
of rigorous assessments of baseline cognition and failure to 
control for it in analyses should be seen as major limitations 
of the included studies and this meta-­analysis. 

[CHUNK 18362]
Physically active 
individuals may have higher cognitive reserve to start with,92 
so studies should examine whether early cognitive ability 
predicts PA later in life. 

[CHUNK 18363]
In many studies investigating PA and 
other health outcomes, work-­related PA shows an inverse asso-
ciation with leisure-­time PA when adjusted for socioeconomic 
status or education.93 94 This may also indicate that higher cogni-
tive ability or other unmeasured confounding factors, and not 
leisure-­time PA, may drive the association with a decreased inci-
dence of dementia. 

[CHUNK 18364]
Almost all studies in this field have adjusted 
their results for education level, a widely used proxy for higher 
cognitive reserve. 

[CHUNK 18365]
Still, people with the same number of years of 
formal education may vary greatly in their cognitive abilities.95 
Many studies have suggested that ApoE ε4 carrier status modi-
fies the relationship between PA and dementia.11–13 Our ApoE ε4 
interaction analyses suggest no such modification for all-­cause 
dementia, Alzheimer’s disease or vascular dementia.


[CHUNK 18366]
Strengths
This meta-­analysis includes extensive data and has examined the 
association of PA and dementia in longer follow-­ups than earlier 
meta-­analyses. 

[CHUNK 18367]
Our quality assessment was specifically devel-
oped to account for the long preclinical period of dementia, 
and the quality assessment of PA has been developed in cooper-
ation with sports and exercise medicine experts (KW and UMK). 


[CHUNK 18368]
We also studied PA levels meeting a fixed threshold (WHO PA 
recommendation), and we addressed dose–response relation-
ships between PA with all-­cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease 
and vascular dementia incidence.


[CHUNK 18369]
Limitations
Some limitations of this meta-­analysis bear mentioning. 

[CHUNK 18370]
Many 
studies used only rough PA measures (eg, a dichotomous yes 
or no question to describe exercise participation). 

[CHUNK 18371]
These rough 
measures coupled with the midpoint or mean estimation of 
MET*min/week PA levels imply that the dose–response meta-­
analyses likely lack precision, especially when the PA levels within 
a group were wide. 

[CHUNK 18372]
Future cohort studies should use objective 
or finer grain PA assessments and make individual participant 
data open whenever possible. 

[CHUNK 18373]
Of the included studies, few were 
high quality, few reported on vascular dementia as an outcome 
and few had any robust measures of cognition at baseline. 

[CHUNK 18374]
The 
stringent criterion of representativeness may have unneces-
sarily limited the number of high-­quality studies. 

[CHUNK 18375]
Additionally, 
some publication bias may have affected the results for all-­cause 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 18376]
We searched only studies 
published in English which is also a possible source of bias.96 
In addition, the impacts of PA modalities which are themselves 
associated with increased risk of dementia (eg, boxing)97 are not 
accounted for in the results presented here.


[CHUNK 18377]
CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
This meta-­analysis found inverse associations between PA levels 
and incidence rates of all-­cause dementia and Alzheimer’s 
disease, even in studies with follow-­ups longer than 20 years. 


[CHUNK 18378]
This finding supports PA as a modifiable protective lifestyle 
factor of dementia. 

[CHUNK 18379]
Policy makers should continue to promote PA 
in school and work-­life reforms, city planning and health initia-
tives. 

[CHUNK 18380]
However, these conclusions should be tempered slightly, as 
the meta-­analysis was based on observational studies with known 
limitations compared with intervention studies, as high-­quality 
studies were scarce and some publication bias was present.

research with long follow-­ups, adjustment for baseline cogni-
tive performance and valid measures of PA and dementia are

needed to confirm these findings. 

[CHUNK 18389]
Finally, long-­term randomised 
controlled trials of exercise interventions are needed to establish 
PA as a causative protective factor for dementia.


[CHUNK 18390]
What is already known on this topic?
	


[CHUNK 18391]
⇒Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a major public 
health concern, and their prevalence is projected to multiply 
in the coming decades.
	


[CHUNK 18392]
⇒There are no drugs to stop or reverse the dementia process, 
but lifestyle interventions in mid-­life may help delay or 
prevent dementias.
	


[CHUNK 18393]
⇒Physical inactivity is associated with an increased incidence 
of dementia, but whether this is due to reverse causation 
whereby lower physical activity results from the dementia 
process is under debate.


[CHUNK 18394]
What this study adds
	
⇒In this meta-­analysis of over 250 000 participants, physical 
activity was significantly associated with a decreased 
incidence of all-­cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, 
irrespective of follow-­up length, baseline age and study 
quality.
	


[CHUNK 18395]
⇒Physical activity was a protective factor for all-­cause 
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, even in follow-­ups longer 
than 20 years, suggesting that the association is not simply 
due to reverse causation.
	


[CHUNK 18396]
⇒Policy makers should support intervention strategies targeting 
societal increases in physical activity in mid-­life, as these may 
reduce dementia incidence.

INTRODUCTION
This article is largely based on the recommendations of the AARP’s Global Council on Brain
Health (GCBH) (1–6). 

[CHUNK 18719]
The AARP is a United States-based interest group whose stated mission
is “to empower people to choose how they live as they age”. 

[CHUNK 18720]
According to the organization, it
had more than 38 million members as of 2018 (7). 

[CHUNK 18721]
The article aims to provide an overview of
the evidence from current literature and expert opinion on key issues known to be relevant in
preserving brain health as people age. 

[CHUNK 18722]
The GCBH is an independent group of scientists, health
professionals, scholars, and policy experts from around the world working in areas of brain health
related to human cognition. 

[CHUNK 18723]
The GCBH is convened by the AARP in collaboration with Age UK.


[CHUNK 18724]
It follows a structured process for generating reliable information, which includes conducting
extensive literature reviews and holding GCBH member meetings to discuss lifestyle issue areas that
may impact brain health as people age. 

[CHUNK 18725]
The goal of the group is to provide speciﬁc, evidence-based
recommendations for people to consider incorporating into their lives to maintain and improve
brain health as they age. 

[CHUNK 18726]
The issues discussed here reﬂect the priorities established by the GCBH.


[CHUNK 18727]
We acknowledge that other entities may disagree on the relevance of the topics presented here. 

[CHUNK 18728]
The
recommendations included within this review are related to mental well-being, exercise, cognitively
stimulating activities, sleep, nutrition, and social connectedness. 

[CHUNK 18729]
Professionals and consumers are
constantly overwhelmed with contradictory information about changes in lifestyle that can impact
brain health. 

[CHUNK 18730]
The AARP created the GCBH to evaluate the evidence that emerges and provide the
professional and the lay consumer with accurate and scientiﬁcally valid information to guide the
lifestyle choices they make to improve their brain health. 

[CHUNK 18731]
Therefore, the goal of this paper is to
summarize these recommendations for professionals.

Lifestyle Choices and Brain Health
BRAIN HEALTH AND MENTAL
WELL-BEING
The goal of this section is to explore the relationship between
mental well-being and brain health. 

[CHUNK 18734]
Mental well-being, for the
purpose of this article, is deﬁned as experiences characterized by
feeling good, functioning well, and adequately coping with life
circumstances and challenges.


[CHUNK 18735]
The GCBH’s interest in this topic was triggered by the
results of the 2018 AARP Brain Health and Mental Well-Being
Survey. 

[CHUNK 18736]
The survey was performed on 2,287 randomly selected,
community dwelling adults in the USA. 

[CHUNK 18737]
The subgroup age over
50 (N = 1,263) was analyzed to better understand the relationship
between mental well-being and brain health in this group. 

[CHUNK 18738]
It was
found that people who scored higher on the scale of mental well-
being tended to report better memory and thinking skills than
those who reported lower mental well-being. 

[CHUNK 18739]
Furthermore, the
AARP found that when a subject rated their episodic memory
and executive function as excellent or very good, they also
reported very high rates of mental well-being. 

[CHUNK 18740]
Comparatively,
those who rated the same functions as average, fair, or poor
reported low rates of mental well-being. 

[CHUNK 18741]
Interestingly, the largest
diﬀerence shown was in how people rated their mental sharpness.


[CHUNK 18742]
Those who rated themselves as having low mental sharpness
reported a nearly 17-point diﬀerence (38.8 compared to 55.5) in
mental well-being from those who said their mental sharpness
was excellent or very good (8). 

[CHUNK 18743]
Based on the results of this survey,
we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between mental
well-being and brain health.


[CHUNK 18744]
Our literature search shows many scientiﬁc studies that
explore the same hypothesis. 

[CHUNK 18745]
For example, Sutin, Stephan, and
Terracciano (9) evaluated the roles of optimism and life purpose
in brain health. 

[CHUNK 18746]
They found that greater optimism, positive
attitude, positive aﬀect, life satisfaction, and purpose in life were
associated with reduced risk of dementia. 

[CHUNK 18747]
When this data was
combined with socioeconomic, psychological, and generational
variables, they discovered that a sense of a purpose in life was one
of the strongest predictors of better brain health. 

[CHUNK 18748]
Furthermore,
the study found that having a purpose in life was associated with
a 20% reduction in dementia risk. 

[CHUNK 18749]
An additional study conducted
by Galderisi et al. 

[CHUNK 18750]
corroborated these ﬁndings and suggested
that a meaningful and goal-driven life also reduces the risk of
dementia (10).


[CHUNK 18751]
If it’s agreed that mental well-being contributes to brain health,
then we should explore which lifestyle choices have an eﬀect
on mental well-being. 

[CHUNK 18752]
For example, as we discuss later in the
section titled “The Brain and Social Connectedness,” individuals
with strong community links have been associated with both
mental well-being and better brain health when compared with
the control group (11, 12). 

[CHUNK 18753]
The same is true for exercise, which
is addressed in “The Brain-Body Connection” portion of this
review (13–21).


[CHUNK 18754]
The opposite also appears to be true. 

[CHUNK 18755]
Research has shown
that early-life stress inﬂuences mental well-being and the brain.


[CHUNK 18756]
Signiﬁcant adverse events early in life can render people
vulnerable to mental illness later in life (22). 

[CHUNK 18757]
Even during
the time of gestation, exposure to excessive levels of cortisone
resulting from high levels of stress can have long lasting eﬀects
by inﬂuencing brain development, subsequently lowering future
levels of mental well-being (23–27). 

[CHUNK 18758]
For example, researchers
have speciﬁcally evaluated the eﬀects of early-life adversity (28–
32). 

[CHUNK 18759]
The research showed a reduction of brain regions responsible
for cognition, such as the hippocampus, in individuals that
were exposed to early-life adversity (33, 34). 

[CHUNK 18760]
Furthermore, the
potential relationship between negative early-life experiences and
the presence of amyloid (the basic lesion observed in Alzheimer’s
Disease) has been suggested in several animal studies including
mouse models of Alzheimer’s Disease (35).


[CHUNK 18761]
Research shows that as we age, we are exposed to both physical
and emotional losses. 

[CHUNK 18762]
However, despite the increase in incidences
associated with loss, getting older does not necessarily mean
experiencing less happiness. 

[CHUNK 18763]
People who manage stress eﬀectively
most or all of the time report greater well-being as they pass
through later stages of life after the age of 50 (36). 

[CHUNK 18764]
In addition,
it should be considered that the way that individuals successfully
manage stress is aﬀected by cultural perceptions, social-economic
status, family structure, and environment (11, 37, 38).


[CHUNK 18765]
A ﬁnal pertinent factor to consider is the relationship between
severe depression and dementia risk. 

[CHUNK 18766]
It has been discovered that
individuals who have normal memory but suﬀer from severe
depression are likely to develop dementia within a few years
(39). 

[CHUNK 18767]
Memory loss symptoms caused by Alzheimer’s and other
related diseases may not manifest themselves for up to 15–20
years after the disease has begun to develop (40). 

[CHUNK 18768]
Because of
this, it is important to acknowledge the possibility that late-life
depression could be the only early manifestation of Alzheimer’s
disease in a given individual.


[CHUNK 18769]
In summary, research shows that mental well-being appears to
be strongly associated with brain health and could potentially be
a protective factor in the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.


[CHUNK 18770]
THE BRAIN-BODY CONNECTION
For many years, clinicians have recommended physical activity
under the belief that it will have a positive impact on brain health
no matter if it results from having a physically active lifestyle
(walking to work or the store in place of driving, taking the stairs,
and engaging in hobbies and sports) or from purposeful exercise
(brisk walking, strength training, and aerobic training).


[CHUNK 18771]
Current research strongly supports this belief. 

[CHUNK 18772]
By analyzing
animal studies, scientists were able to determine that exercise
facilitates neuroplasticity and improves learning outcomes (17,
18). 

[CHUNK 18773]
The same seems to be true for humans. 

[CHUNK 18774]
Coelho found
that physical exercise eﬀectively increases the peripheral levels
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein in
the brain that promotes growth and maintenance of neurons
in the elderly (15). 

[CHUNK 18775]
Furthermore, Baker et al. 

[CHUNK 18776]
conducted a
randomized trial comparing both high-intensity aerobic exercise
and stretching to stretching alone over 6 months (14). 

[CHUNK 18777]
The results
showed the sex-speciﬁc eﬀects of aerobic exercise on cognition,
glucose metabolism, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
and trophic activity as well as comparable improvements in
cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and body fat reduction. 

[CHUNK 18778]
Interestingly,
diﬀerent results were observed in women and men. 

[CHUNK 18779]

[CHUNK 18780]
Mintzer et al.


[CHUNK 18781]
Lifestyle Choices and Brain Health
aerobic exercise enhanced performance on multiple tests. 

[CHUNK 18782]
Their
results showed improved executive function while increasing
glucose disposal during the metabolic clamp and reducing fasting
plasma levels of insulin, cortisol, and BDNF. 

[CHUNK 18783]
For men, aerobic
exercise increased plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor
1, but only had a favorable eﬀect on a single measure of
performance (17).


[CHUNK 18784]
Other studies have focused on demonstrating the neurological
correlations between aerobic exercise and brain health (41).


[CHUNK 18785]
For example, a study by Colcombe et al. 

[CHUNK 18786]
examined whether
aerobic ﬁtness training in older adults can increase brain volume
in regions associated with age-related decline in both brain
structure and cognition. 

[CHUNK 18787]
They found a signiﬁcant increase
in both gray and white matter regions of the brain in
those who participated in the aerobic ﬁtness training but
not in the older adults who participated in the stretching
and toning (non-aerobic) control group (17). 

[CHUNK 18788]
Finally, several
meta-analyses have conﬁrmed the role of exercise in brain
health. 

[CHUNK 18789]
These studies documented a signiﬁcantly reduced risk of
dementia and mild cognitive impairment associated with midlife
exercise (13, 16, 18–21, 42–45).


[CHUNK 18790]
While not all studies relating physical activity to brain heath
have showed corresponding results (46), the GCBH felt that
the evidence was strong enough to support a recommendation
consistent with those from the American Heart Association of
150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and 2 or more
days a week of moderate-intensity weight training (47).


[CHUNK 18791]
COGNITIVELY STIMULATING ACTIVITIES
Cognitively stimulating activities are deﬁned as mentally
engaging activities or exercises that challenge a person’s
ability to think and process information. 

[CHUNK 18792]
These include mind-
teaser games, educational activities, intellectual inquiries, and
mental challenges.


[CHUNK 18793]
It has been well-established that brain structures and functions
change as an individual ages (48). 

[CHUNK 18794]
These changes, however, are
not universal. 

[CHUNK 18795]
Some individuals at the age of 80 have the same
volume of certain brain structures associated with cognitive
function, such as the hippocampus, as they did in their 30s.


[CHUNK 18796]
Others show substantial volume loss (49). 

[CHUNK 18797]
The challenge is to
understand which factors are responsible for these important
diﬀerences. 

[CHUNK 18798]
Education and learning have been known to enhance
cognitive reserves, making an individual less susceptible to the
eﬀects of age or disease-related brain changes (50).


[CHUNK 18799]
Research has shown that brain plasticity continues to be
present through the aging process; therefore, we can hypothesize
that cognitively stimulating activities could help maintain
cognitive function or delay cognitive decline (51, 52). 

[CHUNK 18800]
Supporting
this hypothesis, several studies have established a link between
participation in self-initiated, cognitively stimulating activities
and brain health (53–59).


[CHUNK 18801]
Unfortunately, this hypothesis still has yet to be demonstrated.


[CHUNK 18802]
The National Academies committee concluded that the “AHRQ
(U.S. 

[CHUNK 18803]
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) systematic
review identiﬁed no speciﬁc interventions to justify mounting
an assertive public health campaign to encourage people to
adopt them for the purpose of preventing cognitive decline and
dementia” (60). 

[CHUNK 18804]
This includes performing what can be described
as cognitively stimulating activities.


[CHUNK 18805]
In conclusion, although there is a large body of evidence
suggesting that cognitive training can improve reasoning,
memory, and speed of processing, the validity of these
connections has yet to be documented in large randomized
control trials. 

[CHUNK 18806]
It is important to note that no speciﬁc “brain game”
or “brain exercise” has shown to be eﬀective on brain health.


[CHUNK 18807]
THE BRAIN-SLEEP CONNECTION
Sleep patterns change during the aging process, with both the
sleep structure and duration becoming signiﬁcantly altered (61).


[CHUNK 18808]
Even though sleep patterns vary substantially between age 25 and
50, the need for sleep does not diﬀer. 

[CHUNK 18809]
Recent literature has shown
that most adults require between 7 and 8 h of sleep a night to main
good physical and brain health (62). 

[CHUNK 18810]
Some of the major changes
observed are related to depth of sleep and continuity of sleeping
patterns. 

[CHUNK 18811]
While most older adults experience no changes in the
length of time it takes them to fall asleep, interruption of sleep
during the night and early wakening are common. 

[CHUNK 18812]
Additionally,
older adults also tend to wake up earlier in the morning and ﬁnd
that staying up late becomes more diﬃcult. 

[CHUNK 18813]
These changes are a
normal part of the aging process and do not aﬀect brain health.


[CHUNK 18814]
However, decreased total sleep time does indeed cause negative
eﬀects (9, 63–65).


[CHUNK 18815]
In the AARP 2016 Sleep and Brain Health Survey, it was found
that 44% of adults 50 years of age or older rated their quality of
sleep as extremely good or very good; 84% said they were mostly
well-rested in the morning; but only 33% reported being very
satisﬁed with the amount of sleep they got daily (65). 

[CHUNK 18816]
The 2016
AARP survey also discovered that while over half (56%) of adults
50 and older reported that they wake up at about the same time
every morning, less than a half (48%) go to bed at same time
and only a third (33%) report getting 7–8 h of sleep at night.


[CHUNK 18817]
Researchers have found that attention memory and executive
function can be negatively aﬀected by getting <8 h of sleep
(66, 67), emphasizing the importance of consistent sleep patterns.


[CHUNK 18818]
Shifts in normal patterns of sleep aside, lack of exposure
to light can cause chemical imbalances, thus altering sleep
patterns (68). 

[CHUNK 18819]
Additional factors that can disrupt sleep are
medical regimens designed to treat a variety of chronic diseases
and debilitating sleep disorders that become more prevalent as
individuals age. 

[CHUNK 18820]
Fortunately, several lifestyle measures can be
taken to overcome these negative shifts. 

[CHUNK 18821]
Increasing time in the
sunlight, consistent sleep routines, and gaining knowledge about
the eﬀects of medications are all vital components in preserving
sleep patterns (69–72).


[CHUNK 18822]
Light exposure has a large inﬂuence on the chemical balance
involved in sleep maintenance. 

[CHUNK 18823]
Exposure to light is critical
to maintaining adequate secretion of melatonin (68, 70). 

[CHUNK 18824]
The
systematic secretion of neurochemicals such as melatonin
provides a key regulatory process for other brain chemicals to
follow in maintaining sleep patterns. 

[CHUNK 18825]
Research has shown that

[CHUNK 18826]
Mintzer et al.


[CHUNK 18827]
Lifestyle Choices and Brain Health
older adults often have limited exposure to daylight. 

[CHUNK 18828]
Because
of this, studies suggest spending time outside without wearing
sunglasses and allowing for higher exposure of light during the
daytime to improve sleep patterns (73). 

[CHUNK 18829]
The use of indoor light
enhancement like phototherapy lamps can also improve sleep
and cognition in elderly adults (74, 75).


[CHUNK 18830]
Secondly, multi-medicine regimens in aging individuals can
be very concerning and have the potential to alter healthy
sleep patterns. 

[CHUNK 18831]
Although a multi-medicine regimen is often
needed to manage chronic disorders, specialists should be
aware of the negative eﬀects benzodiazepines, anticholinergics,
hypnotics, barbiturates, antipsychotics, some antidepressants,
and prescribed or over-the-counter (OTC) medicines have on
older adults (76). 

[CHUNK 18832]
It is important for clinicians to remember that
many OTC medicines have mixtures of compounds that can
impair sleep (77). 

[CHUNK 18833]
Patients should also be encouraged to gather
more information from their health care providers to learn about
the potential negative eﬀects multi-medicine regimens have on
their sleep patterns.


[CHUNK 18834]
In regards to pathological conditions related to sleep,
insomnia is the most widely reported sleep disorder in older
adults (78). 

[CHUNK 18835]
Insomnia in older adults is often inaccurately
characterized as diﬃculty falling asleep when it is actually
fragmented sleep and diﬃculty staying asleep. 

[CHUNK 18836]
Large studies have
clearly documented the risk fragmented sleep poses to brain
health (79). 

[CHUNK 18837]
Older adults who have fragmented sleep vs. 

[CHUNK 18838]
those
who do not are at an increased risk of cerebral small vessel disease
and poor cognitive and emotional functioning (66). 

[CHUNK 18839]
Furthermore,
insomnia carries an increased risk factor for stroke and is one
of the main contributors to the development of depression
(80, 81). 

[CHUNK 18840]
Approaches to treat insomnia include behavioral and
lifestyle changes, limiting the need for pharmaceutical treatment
to induce and sustain sleep (82).


[CHUNK 18841]
Sleep apnea is also very common sleep disorder in older
adults. 

[CHUNK 18842]
It is characterized by the collapsing of airways during
sleep, thus making it diﬃcult to breath. 

[CHUNK 18843]
Approximately one-
third of individuals suﬀering from sleep apnea experience severe
symptoms, while up to two-thirds of adults 65 years and older
will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe (83). 

[CHUNK 18844]
Sleep
apnea has been shown to cause degeneration of brain tissue and
the brain stem (84, 85). 

[CHUNK 18845]
Fortunately, research has shown that
some of the damage can be reversed when appropriate treatment
is implemented, improving sleep quality and increasing blood-
oxygen levels (63). 

[CHUNK 18846]
The tissues in our airways begin to sag as we
age, causing the airway to collapse and consequently resulting in
sleep apnea. 

[CHUNK 18847]
Furthermore, individuals aged 65 and older suﬀer
from increased rates of cognitive impairment and dementias
when ailed with sleep apnea. 

[CHUNK 18848]
Studies prove, however, that
improvements in cognitive function are possible in Alzheimer’s
patients with sleep apnea when treated with continuous positive
airways pressure (CPAP) (86).


[CHUNK 18849]
Experts will agree that one key element to maintaining brain
health is an adult’s ability to sleep 7–8 h in a 24-h period.


[CHUNK 18850]
According the 2016 AARP survey, 45% of adults 55 years and
older in the USA nap once a week or more (9). 

[CHUNK 18851]
It is possible for an
individual to complete their 7–8 h of necessary sleep with regular
napping; however, this concept is controversial (87). 

[CHUNK 18852]
Despite
some studies suggesting that naps may be useful for older adults,
there have not been large studies performed to test the eﬀects of
napping on cognition. 

[CHUNK 18853]
It is important to note that naps of 30 min
or less in the early afternoon have not resulted in any negative
eﬀects on nighttime sleep, but long, late afternoon naps can upset
nighttime sleep and generate disruptions in the sleep cycle.


[CHUNK 18854]
Finally, changes in hormones observed in women’s transition
through perimenopause and menopause can cause sleep
disturbances (88). 

[CHUNK 18855]
Surges of adrenaline often result in hot ﬂashes
that can cause stress and changes in body temperature, resulting
in the disruption of sleep patterns (89).


[CHUNK 18856]
In summary, obtaining 7–8 h of sleep per 24-h period has been
reported to be critical in preserving brain health. 

[CHUNK 18857]
Paying special
attention to lifestyle habits such as a routine sleep pattern as well
as monitoring prescribed and OTC medicines and total length of
exposure to light can be extremely beneﬁcial. 

[CHUNK 18858]
Napping in the early
afternoon can also be productive if it is utilized to complete the 7
to 8-h recommended sleep duration. 

[CHUNK 18859]
Lastly, sleep disorders such
as sleep apnea and insomnia are common with age so it is vital to
identify and treat them before they cause permanent disruption
in sleep patterns.


[CHUNK 18860]
BRAIN FOOD
The GCBH also examined the link between certain nutrients,
foods, and dietary patterns that could potentially lead to better
cognitive outcomes in older adults (90–92). 

[CHUNK 18861]
To that end, this
review considered studies including nutritional mechanisms,
observational studies, and randomized controlled trials (93–103).


[CHUNK 18862]
These studies have shown that eating patterns aﬀect brain health
over an individual’s entire life span, supporting the importance
of eating a balanced diet. 

[CHUNK 18863]
For example, there is growing evidence
that nutrients such as vitamins and minerals are highly beneﬁcial
when taken as part of a balanced diet rather than as concentrated
supplements. 

[CHUNK 18864]
The following are various diets that were evaluated
by the GCBH and determined to be “brain-healthy”:
The Mediterranean Diet
The Mediterranean Diet [MeDi] reﬂects the patterns of food
consumption in Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Italy,
and Spain. 

[CHUNK 18865]
In general terms, it is characterized by a high intake
of monounsaturated fats (with extra virgin olive oil as the main
source), vegetables, fruits, plant proteins, whole grains, and ﬁsh.


[CHUNK 18866]
This diet limits the consumption of red meat, reﬁned grains, and
sweets. 

[CHUNK 18867]
It often includes the moderate intake of wine, usually red,
during one of the meals. 

[CHUNK 18868]
Numerous studies, observational, and
controlled, (93–97) have found that the MeDi provides additional
health beneﬁts such as decreased risk of AD, cardiovascular
disease, and type two diabetes. 

[CHUNK 18869]
For example, a study conducted
by Scarmeas et al. 

[CHUNK 18870]
evaluated the eﬀects of the MeDi on over
2,000 New York residents over a 1.5-year period. 

[CHUNK 18871]
The results
showed that subjects who moderately adhered to the MeDi
experienced 15–21% less risk for development of AD, whereas
those who strongly adhered to the MeDi had 39–40% less risk
for development of AD (93).

Lifestyle Choices and Brain Health
Nordic Diet
The Nordic Diet draws upon the types of food consumed in
Scandinavian countries including Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, and Sweden (98). 

[CHUNK 18875]
As in the case of the MeDi, there is an
emphasis on non-animal nutrients such as fruits and vegetables.


[CHUNK 18876]
The Nordic Diet has also incorporated the consumption of
ﬁsh, oils, and several types of meat. 

[CHUNK 18877]
However, the MeDi and
the Nordic Diet diverge in regards to the speciﬁc vegetables,
fruits, cooking styles, and the type and quantity of oil utilized.


[CHUNK 18878]
For example, the Nordic Diet uses rapeseed oil (canola oil)
instead of olive oil. 

[CHUNK 18879]
A 4-year study on 1,140 randomly selected
men and women with normal cognition was conducted to
examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of
the Nordic Diet with cognitive function. 

[CHUNK 18880]
Assessments by the
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
(CERAD) neuropsychological battery and the Mini-mental State
Examination (MMSE) showed that participants who followed
the guidelines of the Nordic Diet experienced increased levels of
cognitive functioning compared to baseline (99).


[CHUNK 18881]
DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension)
The DASH Diet is characterized by a low intake of sodium and
small portion sizes, which studies have shown to have substantial
health beneﬁts. 

[CHUNK 18882]
These include improved blood pressure and
blood lipids as well as a reduced risk of chronic disease (100). 

[CHUNK 18883]
The
diﬀerence between the DASH Diet vs. 

[CHUNK 18884]
the MeDi and Nordic diet
is the DASH Diet’s inclusion of nuts, low-fat and non-fat dairy
products, lean meats, and whole grains. 

[CHUNK 18885]
A study conducted by
Appel et al. 

[CHUNK 18886]
included 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of
<160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressures of 80–95 mm Hg, 133
of which suﬀered from hypertension. 

[CHUNK 18887]
After 3 weeks of adhering
to the DASH Diet, the 133 subjects with hypertension decreased
their systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg
more, respectively, than those in the control group (101).


[CHUNK 18888]
Okinawan Diet
The Okinawan diet is based on the eating habits of indigenous
people residing in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. 

[CHUNK 18889]
Their eating
habits were studied as scientists became aware of the population’s
exceptional longevity. 

[CHUNK 18890]
The Okinawan diet emphasizes the
consumption of yellow, orange, and green vegetables and
includes soy and legumes. 

[CHUNK 18891]
It also limits the intake of reﬁned
grains, sugar, salt, and diary. 

[CHUNK 18892]
Notably, the diet focuses on the
use of sweet potato and very small quantities of ﬁsh and rice.


[CHUNK 18893]
An additional point of interest is that this group does not eat
until feeling full, but until hunger has subsided. 

[CHUNK 18894]
A study done by
Miyagi et al. 

[CHUNK 18895]
discovered that, in 1990, the residents of Okinawa’s
life expectancy at birth (LEB) was of the highest in the world
while their risk of ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular
disease was at a record low. 

[CHUNK 18896]
The evidence showed that their
superior health was due to a daily intake of meat and pulses at
90 grams, which is about 20 and 30% higher than the national
average, respectively. 

[CHUNK 18897]
Another contributor to their notable LEB
and decreased risk of disease was their daily intake of green
and yellow vegetables was about 50% higher than the national
average (102).


[CHUNK 18898]
MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention
for Neurodegenerative Delay) Diet
The MIND diet draws from both the MeDi and the DASH
diets. 

[CHUNK 18899]
It recommends ingesting green leafy vegetables six times
a week, other vegetables at least once a day, and two or
more servings of berries per week. 

[CHUNK 18900]
The MIND diet advocates
snacking on nuts as well as consuming beans every other day,
poultry twice a week, and ﬁsh at least once a week. 

[CHUNK 18901]
Finally,
the proposed diet sets very strict limits on butter, cheese, fried
food, and fast food. 

[CHUNK 18902]
A study among 960 participants over 4.7
years. 

[CHUNK 18903]
Morris et al. 

[CHUNK 18904]
conducted a study that implemented the
dietary components from both the MeDi and the DASH diet
shown to be neuroprotective, such as high consumption of
vegetables and consumption of berries to develop the MIND diet.


[CHUNK 18905]
Those who adhered to the MIND diet the most tended to have
a more favorable risk proﬁle for preserving cognitive abilities
including higher education, greater participation in cognitive
and physical activities, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular
conditions (103, 104).


[CHUNK 18906]
Several common trends can be highlighted among these
diets.


[CHUNK 18907]
They
all
recommend
avoiding
trans-unsaturated
fatty
acids
(trans-fats)
found
in
processed
foods,
such
as partially hydrogenated oils, since they are known to
raise the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and decrease the
high-density lipoprotein (LDL). 

[CHUNK 18908]
Studies have shown that
eating
trans-fats
increases
the
risk
of
developing
heart
disease, stroke, and type two diabetes; all conditions that
can negatively aﬀect brain health (105). 

[CHUNK 18909]
Trans-fats are not
only found in large amounts of processed foods, but also
fried foods, baked goods, and a large variety of products
found in super markets such as margarine, crackers, cookies,
and pizzas.


[CHUNK 18910]
Options for healthy dietary fats, on the other hand, include
polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3 fatty acids. 

[CHUNK 18911]
Given the
vast amount of literature available on omega 3-fatty acids and
brain health, it is important to highlight its beneﬁcial qualities.


[CHUNK 18912]
Studies on omega-3 fatty acids have focused on the full range
of fatty acids as opposed to examining the speciﬁc types.


[CHUNK 18913]
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the most prevalent omega-3
fatty acid in the brain and is involved in neuronal membrane
plasticity (106). 

[CHUNK 18914]
Although the most widely known source of
omega-3 fatty acids is ﬁsh, there are plant sources that provide
omega-3 fatty acids as well. 

[CHUNK 18915]
These include olives, canola, ﬂaxseed,
soybeans, and butternut squash. 

[CHUNK 18916]
Nuts and seeds such as walnuts
and sunﬂower seeds also contain high levels of vital omega-
3 fatty acids. 

[CHUNK 18917]
Although plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids
exist, the evidence supporting their beneﬁcial properties is not
as substantial as it is for ﬁsh (107).


[CHUNK 18918]
The topic of salt has been the focus of many studies. 

[CHUNK 18919]
There
is well-established evidence supporting the connection between
high sodium consumption and stroke (101, 108). 

[CHUNK 18920]
The American
Heart Association recommends that Americans lower their
sodium intake to <1,500 mg per day because of the correlated
health beneﬁts. 

[CHUNK 18921]
Research has shown that this guideline not only
reduces the risk of stroke, but also decreases the risk of heart
attack and heart failure (109).

[CHUNK 18924]
Lifestyle Choices and Brain Health
Other topics of interest are the consumption of caﬀeine
and coco ﬂavonoids. 

[CHUNK 18925]
Several studies have shown a signiﬁcant
relationship between coﬀee and tea consumption and decreased
cognitive decline (110). 

[CHUNK 18926]
These beneﬁts have been attributed
to polyphenol; a chemical compound found in plant-based
food that is a vital antioxidant. 

[CHUNK 18927]
The type and amount that
must be consumed to be beneﬁcial to brain health over an
individual’s lifespan have not been stipulated. 

[CHUNK 18928]
However, a short-
term beneﬁt of coﬀee and tea consumption is increased alertness.


[CHUNK 18929]
Regarding cocoa ﬂavonoids (often found in dark chocolate),
there have been studies conducted researching the eﬀects they
have on brain health to enhance cognition (111, 112). 

[CHUNK 18930]
Indeed,
preliminary data suggest that cocoa ﬂavonoids could have a
positive eﬀect on brain health; however, the study performed
on participants with cognitive impairment involving cocoa
ﬂavonoids was inconclusive.


[CHUNK 18931]
It is impossible to talk about nutrition without discussing
the issue of weight. 

[CHUNK 18932]
Several studies have linked obesity in an
individual’s midlife to an increased risk of future cognitive decline
(113). 

[CHUNK 18933]
Although, there is controversy over whether weight loss
at an older age is productive. 

[CHUNK 18934]
In order to eﬀectively optimize
your diet to improve your brain and heart health, nutritious,
lower calorie options are the most beneﬁcial. 

[CHUNK 18935]
A study involving
a 4-year active lifestyle intervention phase as well as a 9-year
extended follow-up was conducted to investigate associations
of long-term nutrient intake, physical activity, and obesity with
later cognitive function (114). 

[CHUNK 18936]
The results indicated that lower
intake of total fat and saturated fatty acids and frequent physical
activity were associated with better cognitive performance.


[CHUNK 18937]
Higher BMI and waist circumference were also associated with
worse performance.


[CHUNK 18938]
In conclusion, current research strongly suggests the beneﬁcial
eﬀects of consuming polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially
ﬁsh) and unprocessed, plant-based nutrients. 

[CHUNK 18939]
Additionally, limits
should be placed on the consumption of salt as well as on
processed foods for they are rich in harmful fats such as LDLs
and could be directly or indirectly harmful to brain health.


[CHUNK 18940]
THE BRAIN AND SOCIAL
CONNECTEDNESS
Humans are, in essence, social animals. 

[CHUNK 18941]
Our growth, experiences,
and some of the variances of our personalities are molded
through social engagement. 

[CHUNK 18942]
Speciﬁcally, the diﬀerent levels of
success in social engagement are major drivers of our quality
of life (115). 

[CHUNK 18943]
Typically, the goal of social engagement is to
relate to others in positive ways through multi-factorial social
networks. 

[CHUNK 18944]
For the purpose of this discussion, the notion of
social engagement refers to social interactions that have positive
outcomes and are pleasing and meaningful to those who engage
in them.


[CHUNK 18945]
Unfortunately, the literature on this subject is limited
because animal models of social engagement are designed and
executed in highly controlled environments in which all possible
relationships between the participants are closely monitored
(116). 

[CHUNK 18946]
This approach would not be ethical to apply in a
human sample; therefore, studies that aim to observe cause and
eﬀect, also known as randomized controlled trials, have not
been applied in this area of brain health. 

[CHUNK 18947]
To gather evidence,
researchers must rely mainly on epidemiological studies in the
area of population biology. 

[CHUNK 18948]
This approach assesses diﬀerent levels
of social interaction and compares individual experiences to
each other instead of controlling levels of social engagement and
determining the eﬀects they have on brain health. 

[CHUNK 18949]
It is important
to note that many variables in real life become blended into
social engagement situations. 

[CHUNK 18950]
For example, people often have
meaningful social interactions around a meal or speciﬁc sport
activity; therefore, human studies on social engagement may
not always be able to establish a causal relationship between
brain health and social interaction. 

[CHUNK 18951]
That being said, solid
research suggests a possible impact of social engagement in brain
health (115–120).


[CHUNK 18952]
Notably, there are a few randomized controlled trials that
tested the impact of real-world communal engagement in adults
50 and over. 

[CHUNK 18953]
The two most substantial studies conducted are the
Experience Corps (55, 121) and the Synapse Project (122). 

[CHUNK 18954]
These
studies were both randomized, controlled trials that exempliﬁed
various structures, functions, and qualities of social activities.


[CHUNK 18955]
The Experience Corps trial compared older adults that either
volunteered to participate in the Experience Corps activities or
who had the opportunity to join volunteer opportunities in the
Baltimore area. 

[CHUNK 18956]
The 702 randomized subjects of 60 years or
older that were included in the study were evaluated at the
4-, 12-, and 22-month mark over a 2-year trial. 

[CHUNK 18957]
Participants
in the randomized Experience Corp group had signiﬁcantly
higher levels of generative desire and higher percentages of
generative achievement than the controls at each follow-up point.


[CHUNK 18958]
Furthermore, the more hours of engagement in the Experience
Corp program, the greater the beneﬁt. 

[CHUNK 18959]
A follow-up randomized,
controlled study involving 111 men and woman in the same
manner as the previous group was conducted to evaluate the
impact of intervention on biomarkers of brain health. 

[CHUNK 18960]
This
subsequent study showed that participants in the Experience
Corp had a signiﬁcant increase in hippocampal volume. 

[CHUNK 18961]
These
results not only exemplify the clinical impact of intervention,
but show a clear biological correlation between brain health and
intervention (56).


[CHUNK 18962]
The second study mentioned is the Synapse Project. 

[CHUNK 18963]
This
project had a similar hypothesis evaluating if the participation
in group activities would aid in the maintenance of cognitive
health in older adults. 

[CHUNK 18964]
Those in the productive engagement
groups were directed to spend 15 h per week in the Synapse
environment, broken down into 5 h of formal instruction and
10 h of course assignments. 

[CHUNK 18965]
There was a total of three productive
engagement groups: a photo group, a quilting group, and a
combined group. 

[CHUNK 18966]
The control group involved an activity that
mimicked a social club. 

[CHUNK 18967]
Finally, there was a placebo group in
which participants spent 15 h per week engaging in activities that
utilized existing knowledge (i.e., watching TV and documentaries
or reading magazines). 

[CHUNK 18968]
The results indicated that a speciﬁc type of
memory (episodic) signiﬁcantly increased in subjects involved in
the productive groups, supporting the hypothesis that sustained
engagement could have beneﬁts in brain health (122).

supporting brain health, loneliness caused by poorly functioning

Lifestyle Choices and Brain Health
relationships, on the other hand, increases the risk of mental
and social disorders. 

[CHUNK 18972]
It is important to note that loneliness is
not the same as isolation; people can feel lonely even when
surrounded by others (123). 

[CHUNK 18973]
Loneliness is the gap between the
social engagement they want and what they currently have.


[CHUNK 18974]
Unfortunately, as people age, social networks tend to become
more limited. 

[CHUNK 18975]
They can begin to diminish as death, disease, or
illness arise, enhancing the feeling of loneliness. 

[CHUNK 18976]
Studies have
shown that loneliness increases the risk of cognitive decline
in older adults (124–127) signiﬁcant loneliness being more
detrimental than episodic loneliness. 

[CHUNK 18977]
Of interest, some early
research suggests that the eﬀect of digital engagement on an
individual’s cognitive ability later in life is similar to that
observed in in-person communication (128–130). 

[CHUNK 18978]
In fact, a study
conducted in the US revealed that older adults, after learning
to use Facebook, performed 25% better in memory tests than
non-Facebook users (131).


[CHUNK 18979]
Another signiﬁcant aspect of social connections are close
relationships such as marriage. 

[CHUNK 18980]
The impact of relationships
like marriage have been studied from both the physical
and emotional point of view. 

[CHUNK 18981]
Participating in a fulﬁlling
romantic relationship can be very beneﬁcial (132, 133),
however, relying exclusively on one primary relationship
for social interactions can lead to isolation if something
were to happen to the other individual involved in this
primary relationship. 

[CHUNK 18982]
Evidence shows that the loss of a
spouse causes dysregulation of stress related hormones such as
cortisol. 

[CHUNK 18983]
Increased cortisol has been association with decreased
hippocampus volume and decreased cognitive performance (134,
135), emphasizing the importance of developing a range of
social relationships.


[CHUNK 18984]
Additionally, research examining the beneﬁts of human-
animal interactions on human health is a continued source
of interest. 

[CHUNK 18985]
These human-animal relationships can be positive
and meaningful (136–139), resulting in increased social contact
and reductions in depression, anxiety, and social isolation.


[CHUNK 18986]
In fact, research has found that Alzheimer’s disease patients
have shown less verbal aggression and anxiety in the presence
of animals. 

[CHUNK 18987]
Similar positive eﬀects can also be found in
relationships with neighbors and other community entities
(140–143). 

[CHUNK 18988]
Higher neighborhood social cohesion provides
residents with a feeling of belonging and elicits positive health
behaviors such as increased physical activity and more smoking
cessation attempts.


[CHUNK 18989]
In conclusion, developing social connections is a fundamental
need among humans that can enhance brain health and even
improve memory. 

[CHUNK 18990]
It is vital to engage in a range of social
networks because relying on one may be detrimental and lead
to loneliness. 

[CHUNK 18991]
Whether the connection is shared between other
humans or animals, online or in-person, social engagement
drives our quality of life and feeling of belonging.

The aging process causes many changes to the brain and is a major risk factor for the
development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). 

[CHUNK 19664]
Despite
an already vast amount of research on AD, a greater understanding of the disease’s
pathology and therapeutic options are desperately needed. 

[CHUNK 19665]
One important distinction
that is also in need of further study is the ability to distinguish changes to the brain
observed in early stages of AD vs. 

[CHUNK 19666]
changes that occur with normal aging. 

[CHUNK 19667]
Current
FDA-approved therapeutic options for AD patients have proven to be ineffective and
indicate the need for alternative therapies. 

[CHUNK 19668]
Aging interventions including alterations in
diet (such as caloric restriction, fasting, or methionine restriction) have been shown to be
effective in mediating increased health and lifespan in mice and other model organisms.


[CHUNK 19669]
Because aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative
diseases, certain dietary interventions should be explored as they have the potential to
act as a future treatment option for AD patients.

INTRODUCTION
Aging is the major risk factor for many diseases but the factors that drive age-related changes and
promote dysfunction are poorly understood. 

[CHUNK 19671]
Slowing or even delaying these processes may lead
to extended periods of health in humans. 

[CHUNK 19672]
With each passing year, aging has a greater impact on
the U.S. 

[CHUNK 19673]
healthcare system. 

[CHUNK 19674]
As of the year 2020, the older adult population (65 years and older) is
comprised of 56 million people and is expected to increase to nearly 90 million by the year 2050
(Alzheimer’s Association, 2020a). 

[CHUNK 19675]
In fact, projections point toward the year 2030 as being the ﬁrst
time in U.S. 

[CHUNK 19676]
history where the population of those over the age of 65 will outnumber those 18
years and younger (Mendiola-Precoma et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 19677]
Aging is associated with an increased risk of
disease and death; therefore, an aging population will place increased burden on our healthcare
system and will have a greater ﬁnancial impact on individuals throughout the country (Rose, 2009;
Mendiola-Precoma et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 19678]
Aging occurs in nearly all organisms and is represented by a physiological decline in function.


[CHUNK 19679]
Decades of work by many scientists led to the identiﬁcation of several hallmarks of aging, many of
which impact the brain as will be later presented. 

[CHUNK 19680]
Various versions of the list exist but many agree
about the general contributors. 

[CHUNK 19681]
However, despite the identiﬁed hallmarks, the exact mechanisms
underlying or driving biological aging remain inadequate to develop therapies to truly combat aging
as a whole. 

[CHUNK 19682]
This has led to alternative hypotheses suggesting that random cellular dysfunctions may
be the greatest contributor to aging, potentially explaining why organisms of the same genotype
(monozygotic twins) who are raised in a common environment have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent life
spans (Kirkwood et al., 2005).


[CHUNK 19683]
Thelen and Brown-Borg
Aging Interventions and Neurodegeneration
An aging population warrants increased attention toward
understanding the mechanisms that drive the aging process. 

[CHUNK 19684]
This
includes considering therapies to slow, delay or prevent aging.


[CHUNK 19685]
Past and current treatment options have focused on interventions
speciﬁc for one disease process at a time (such as FDA drug
approval for speciﬁc diseases). 

[CHUNK 19686]
This has been one approach
contributing to the increase in population health over a span
of decades, as evidenced by an increase in U.S. 

[CHUNK 19687]
life expectancy
from 69.9 to 78.9 years from the years 1959 to 2016. 

[CHUNK 19688]
However,
recent data suggests that U.S. 

[CHUNK 19689]
life expectancy is reaching a plateau
or even slightly decreasing (Woolf and Schoomaker, 2019). 

[CHUNK 19690]
A
greater understanding of aging oﬀers vast potential toward the
ﬁeld of medicine. 

[CHUNK 19691]
It provides hope for slower disease progression
and increased life expectancy in humans. 

[CHUNK 19692]
However, the ultimate
goal is to lengthen the overall time individuals remain disease-
free (increased health-span), which would have a major positive
impact on individuals and the healthcare system.


[CHUNK 19693]
BRAIN AGING AND AD
Aging impacts many organ systems, but the brain garners a
large share of the interest and funding. 

[CHUNK 19694]
The brain undergoes
prominent structural and functional changes throughout a
lifetime. 

[CHUNK 19695]
Structurally, normal brain aging involves atrophy
seen through reductions in both gray and white matter and
an associated enlargement of the cerebral ventricles (Drayer,
1988). 

[CHUNK 19696]
These age-related reductions in gray matter are most
notable in the frontal and temporal lobes (Jack et al., 1997).


[CHUNK 19697]
Much of this normal brain atrophy appears to be due to
neuronal loss, neuronal morphology changes, and dendritic
and synaptic reductions (Terry and Katzman, 2001; Dumitriu
et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 19698]
Other structural brain changes observed in
normal aging include increased visualization of amyloid-β
plaques, neuroﬁbrillary tangles, white matter injuries, small-
vessel ischemia, and microhemorrhages (Terry and Katzman,
2001; Park et al., 2013; Prins and Scheltens, 2015; Shim et al.,
2015; Ramirez et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 19699]
Functional changes to the brain
with increased age include a gradual decline in attention,
memory, decision-making speed, learning, motor coordination,
and sensory perceptions (Alexander et al., 2012; Dykiert et al.,
2012; Levin et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19700]
Cognitive function is most aﬀected in
the areas of executive function, working memory, and episodic
memory (Alexander et al., 2012).


[CHUNK 19701]
Aging is the greatest risk factor for developing many
neurodegenerative
diseases
(Hou
et
al.,
2019).


[CHUNK 19702]
Broad
classiﬁcation
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
includes
amyloidoses,
tauopathies,
synucleinopathies,
and
TDP-43
proteinopathies (Dugger and Dickson, 2017). 

[CHUNK 19703]
Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD), a mixed amyloidose and tauopathy pathology,
is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the U.S.


[CHUNK 19704]
Currently, AD is ﬁve times more prevalent than Parkinson’s
Disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease,
and this margin is expected to continue increasing. 

[CHUNK 19705]
To date,
AD aﬀects nearly ﬁve million Americans (1 in 10 people over
the age of 65) and is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S.


[CHUNK 19706]
These numbers are expected to grow as 13.8 million people are
projected to be living with AD by the year 2050. 

[CHUNK 19707]
Furthermore,
AD and related dementias will cost the U.S. 

[CHUNK 19708]
over $300 billion in
2020 with an expectation to increase to more than $1 trillion by
the year 2050 (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020a).


[CHUNK 19709]
Despite great eﬀort from the scientiﬁc community, the
primary cause of AD remains unknown. 

[CHUNK 19710]
Risk factors for
developing familial AD (leading to early onset symptoms)
include mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP),
presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 genes (Bekris et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 19711]
However,
risk factors for the much more common sporadic development of
AD include increased age and mutations to the ApoE4 allele (Liu
et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 19712]
Features of an AD brain involve noticeable amyloid-
beta (Aβ) plaques and p-tau neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Bloom,
2014). 

[CHUNK 19713]
Aβ peptides are produced after the proteolysis of the type
I integral membrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP)
(Esch et al., 1990; Shoji et al., 1992; Haass and Selkoe, 1993;
Haass et al., 1993; Jarrett et al., 1993). 

[CHUNK 19714]
Aβ plaque and p-tau
neuroﬁbrillary tangle formation starts with altered APP cleavage
by β-secretases (BACE1) and γ-secretases to produce insoluble
Aβ ﬁbrils. 

[CHUNK 19715]
These Aβ ﬁbrils then polymerize into insoluble
amyloid ﬁbrils which aggregate into plaques (Fontana et al.,
2004; Simunkova et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19716]
Polymerization of Aβ ﬁbrils cause
activation of kinases which hyperphosphorylate microtubule
associated p-tau and lead to their polymerization into insoluble
neuroﬁbrillary tangles. 

[CHUNK 19717]
Accumulation of Aβ plaques and p-
tau neuroﬁbrillary tangles lead to microglial activation and are
associated with neurotoxicity (Long and Holtzman, 2019).


[CHUNK 19718]
Disruption
of
cerebral
vasculature
is
associated
with
neuroinﬂammation in mice studies and has also been shown to
contribute to aging and AD (Tarantini et al., 2017; Fulop et al.,
2019). 

[CHUNK 19719]
Regions of the brain with increased activity rely on a
mechanism known as neurovascular coupling (NVC) to receive
a compensatory uptick in regional oxygen and glucose. 

[CHUNK 19720]
NVC
works through the release of the vasodilating molecule nitric
oxide (NO) from microvascular endothelial cells surrounding
areas of metabolically active neurons and astrocytes (Toth et al.,
2014, 2015; Tarantini et al., 2017, 2018, 2019a). 

[CHUNK 19721]
Interruption of
the NVC mechanism tends to be found in older adults and it
also leads to cognitive impairment in mice (Fabiani et al., 2014;
Tarantini et al., 2017, 2018, 2019a; Lipecz et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19722]
In fact,
in mouse models of aging, interventions which improve NVC
and cerebral microvasculature also improve cognitive function
(Csiszar et al., 2019; Tarantini et al., 2019b; Wiedenhoeft et al.,
2019). 

[CHUNK 19723]
Currently functional MRI (fMRI) is one method of
measuring NVC in humans, yet many new technologies are
being studied for their usefulness in monitoring the cerebral
microvascular changes that accompany aging (Csipo et al., 2019;
Lipecz et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 19724]
AD is a slow progressing disease characterized by a decline
in cognitive function. 

[CHUNK 19725]
Recent estimates report the preclinical
(asymptomatic) stage of AD occurs for up to 15 to 20 years
prior to clinical symptom emergence (Morris et al., 2001; Sperling
et al., 2011, 2013). 

[CHUNK 19726]
This is based upon examinations of brains of
older individuals, who die with no cognitive impairment or mild
cognitive impairment, often revealing similar pathology to those
with apparent AD (Mufson et al., 1999; Price and Morris, 1999;
Bennett et al., 2005; Markesbery et al., 2006).

Aging Interventions and Neurodegeneration
into early stage (mild), middle stage (moderate), and late stages
(severe forms). 

[CHUNK 19729]
Mild and moderate stages may last for years at
a time as the individual’s memory, cognitive ability, and ability
to live independently slowly decline. 

[CHUNK 19730]
By the late stage of AD, the
individual loses their ability to respond to their environment,
carry on a conversation, and eventually control movement.


[CHUNK 19731]
Memory and cognition also continue to decline during this time.


[CHUNK 19732]
Most people only live for 4 to 8 years following ﬁrst diagnosis
(Alzheimer’s Association, 2020b).


[CHUNK 19733]
A closer look at the speciﬁc hallmarks of aging as
they relate to the central nervous system is warranted.


[CHUNK 19734]
The nine hallmarks of aging include genomic instability,
telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis,
mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, dysregulated
nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular
communication and immune function (López-Otín et al., 2013).


[CHUNK 19735]
Many of these hallmarks are associated with neurodegenerative
diseases such as AD. 

[CHUNK 19736]
Studies have found increased DNA damage
and altered DNA repair mechanisms in the brains of AD
patients (Lovell et al., 1999). 

[CHUNK 19737]
Certain epigenetic markers, such as
methylation patterns in APP promoters of primates, are related
to neurodegenerative features (Bradley-Whitman and Lovell,
2013). 

[CHUNK 19738]
The mitophagy process seems to be defective in AD, such
that stimulation of mitophagy in nematode and mouse models
improved memory (Fang et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19739]
Brain cells from AD
models demonstrate reduced glucose and oxygen metabolic rates
(Camandola and Mattson, 2017). 

[CHUNK 19740]
Additionally, Aβ oligomers
trigger senescence of neurons in vitro and senescent astrocytes,
microglia, and neurons are found in greater numbers in human
AD brains (He et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 19741]
In vivo and in vitro studies have
found that APP expression on microglial cells is required for their
proinﬂammatory activation to Aβ oligomers (Manocha et al.,
2016). 

[CHUNK 19742]
Thus, several aspects of the underlying pathology and
clinical features found with AD, mirror those observed in the
established hallmarks of aging.


[CHUNK 19743]
Distinguishing normal changes to the brain with age vs.


[CHUNK 19744]
pathological changes remains a challenge to date. 

[CHUNK 19745]
Diﬃculty arises
from evidence indicating that many of the structural changes
to the brain found in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD,
resemble the structural changes observed in a normal aging
brain. 

[CHUNK 19746]
High levels of amyloid-β plaques, neuroﬁbrillary tangles,
synaptic loss, and neuroinﬂammation are hallmarks of AD. 

[CHUNK 19747]
As
previously discussed, these changes also comprise part of normal
aging of the brain and it is not uncommon for these same
features to be seen in a non-demented, older individual (Denver
and McClean, 2018). 

[CHUNK 19748]
However, many of the structural changes
displayed in neurodegenerative diseases are more frequent and
more severe than in the normal aging process (Park et al., 2013;
Prins and Scheltens, 2015; Shim et al., 2015; Ramirez et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 19749]
Unfortunately, in the case of AD, by the time these structural
changes have accumulated enough to begin manifesting in
symptoms, the neuropathology is irreversible. 

[CHUNK 19750]
A greater ability
to distinguish AD pathology, especially in its early stages, vs.


[CHUNK 19751]
normal aging would lead to improved diagnostic capabilities and
potential new drug discoveries (Denver and McClean, 2018).


[CHUNK 19752]
THERAPIES FOR AD
Therapies to treat AD progression range from FDA-approved
compounds to exercise, nutraceuticals and dietary interventions
(Figure 1).


[CHUNK 19753]
Importantly,
current
treatment
options
for
Alzheimer’s Disease lack eﬀectiveness. 

[CHUNK 19754]
Only two therapeutic
options are approved by the FDA, that being cholinesterase
inhibitors (Donepezil, Rivastigmine, and Galantamine) and
Memantine (an NMDA receptor antagonist/dopamine agonist)
(Howard et al., 2012; Grossberg et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 19755]
Both options
oﬀer mild symptom management with no eﬀect on long term
progression of the disease. 

[CHUNK 19756]
Additionally, over 20 compounds
have reached large phase 3, double-blind, randomized control
trials in cohorts of AD patients at various stages of disease
progression, yet none have shown the ability to improve global
functioning or slow cognitive decline (Long and Holtzman,
2019).


[CHUNK 19757]
Due to the ineﬀectiveness of AD therapeutics, alternative
treatment
options
are
being
explored.


[CHUNK 19758]
Huperzine
A,
a
nutraceutical, has been shown to increase memory and
activities of daily living in AD patients (Xing et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19759]
This
compound, along with other herbal drugs such as huperzine B,
ginseng, corilagen, and curcumin oﬀer therapeutic potential for
AD due to their ability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB)
and act through the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
chelation of redox-active metals, inhibition of the aggregation
of Aβ and reduction of neuroinﬂammation (Simunkova et al.,
2019). 

[CHUNK 19760]
However, these drugs are not approved by the FDA
and may suﬀer from lack of purity and potency (Xing et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 19761]
Recently, several small clinical studies have shown a
relationship between a ketogenic diet and improved cognition
in AD and other neurodegenerative disease patients (Rusek
et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19762]
Administration of medium-chain triglyceride-based
ketogenic formula for 12 weeks to 20 patients with mild-to-
moderate AD led to a signiﬁcant increase in working memory,
short-term memory, and processing speed. 

[CHUNK 19763]
Speciﬁcally, these
patients showed improvements in the digit-symbol coding
test as well as the immediate and delayed logical memory
tests (Ota et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19764]
Many treatments for AD are designed
to target the production and/or accumulation of Aβ and
tau proteins, but this approach has not been promising so
far. 

[CHUNK 19765]
Monoclonal antibodies designed to target and remove
abnormal amyloid beta have shown no improvement in
cognitive function in early and late stage AD patients (Doody
et al., 2014; Salloway et al., 2014; Honig et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 19766]
Potential
vaccines against tau protein are currently under investigation
as well as deep brain stimulation and gamma-frequency
oscillation therapies (Weller and Budson, 2018; Koseoglu, 2019).


[CHUNK 19767]
Thus, although numerous therapies have been explored, very
few clinical options are currently available to stop or slow
progression of neurodegenerative disorders. 

[CHUNK 19768]
There are numerous
reports showing an association between diet, exercise, and
reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, but
these are not considered in this discussion of treatments for
ongoing disease.

MODELS OF AD
AD is modeled in the laboratory to address the biology of
speciﬁc cell types as well as in mice primarily, to study disease
onset, progression, and treatment. 

[CHUNK 19772]
Mouse models, including
transgenic and non-transgenic options, are most common for
the investigation of AD and oﬀer a variety of pros and cons
(Puzzo et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19773]
Several transgenic mouse lines have been
created to mimic human AD pathology. 

[CHUNK 19774]
These animals are
genetically engineered to overexpress one or more of the
proteins found in human AD patients and often include APP,
tau, and/or presenilin.

One commonly used mouse line is the
double transgenic APP/PS1 which develop a robust deposition of
amyloid-beta plaques due to mutations in APP on chromosome
21 and presenilin 1 (PS1) on chromosome 14. 

[CHUNK 19776]
These mice show
increased levels of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 at an early age which
allows for study of an AD-related phenotype (Puzzo et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 19777]
Behavior studies of transgenic mice aim to assess the
cognitive domains of these AD models in ways that are similar
to what is observed in human AD. 

[CHUNK 19778]
Alterations to working
memory, executive function, and attention are common aspects
of cognition which are disrupted in human AD and can also
be studied in transgenic mice. 

[CHUNK 19779]
In humans, working memory is
assessed through verbal tasks, yet working memory is typically
studied in mice through maze-type tasks in which spatial working
memory is evaluated. 

[CHUNK 19780]
AD transgenic mice show deﬁcits in
working memory by taking longer to learn where the food reward
is located and which aspects of the maze they have previously
visited (Webster et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19781]
Executive function requires higher
order cognition such as planning, reasoning, and cognitive
ﬂexibility and is observed in humans through tests such as the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (Drewe, 1974; Robinson et al.,
1980; Arnett et al., 1994). 

[CHUNK 19782]
AD transgenic mice show deﬁcits in
executive function abilities through tasks involving set-shifting,
reversal learning, and response inhibition (Zhuo et al., 2007;
Papadopoulos et al., 2013; Romberg et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 19783]
The most widely
used method of examining disruptions in attention for transgenic
mice is through tasks, such as the ﬁve-choice serial-reaction time
task (5-CSRTT), that utilize sustained attention divided among
multiple spatial locations, where a large number of trials and
errors of commission, omission, and reaction time are scored
(Webster et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19784]
These rodent tests most closely resemble
Leonard’s 5-CSRTT and Continuous Performance Tests (CPT)
of sustained attention used in humans, however, there remains
diﬃculty translating attention results from mice AD models to
those seen in humans (Rosvold et al., 1956; Wilkinson, 1963;
Young et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 19785]
The study of AD through transgenic mice (including APP/PS1
mice) is limited in some ways. 

[CHUNK 19786]
First, transgenic mice express
a genetic form of AD while most cases in humans are not
genetically based, but rather develop sporadically at older ages.


[CHUNK 19787]
Additionally, transgenic mutations introduced into mice are
not able to match the complexity seen in AD such that no
mouse models can reproduce the full spectrum of human AD
symptoms and pathology (Tai et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 19788]
Non-transgenic
models of AD typically involve molecular (such as Aβ or
tau) intracerebroventricular or intrahippocampal injections into
mice. 

[CHUNK 19789]
This method of investigation oﬀers the beneﬁt of studying
acute eﬀects on brain tissue of Aβ or tau exposure, which is
more like the sporadic development of AD pathology typically

Aging Interventions and Neurodegeneration
occurring in humans when compared to transgenic mice. 

[CHUNK 19791]
Yet,
non-transgenic mice do not reproduce the gradual rise of Aβ
that occurs over many years in humans and it does not replicate
the spreading of pathology through regions of the brain, which
is a major component of AD pathology (Puzzo et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 19792]
Ultimately, while there remains uncertainty as to how similar
pathogenic pathways found in mice are to those in humans,
mouse models are a valuable tool for the study of the AD process
(Shineman et al., 2011).


[CHUNK 19793]
THERAPIES FOR AGING
Currently, there are no FDA approved interventions to slow
and/or delay aging. 

[CHUNK 19794]
However, the search is on for drugs that
may alter the aging process in humans. 

[CHUNK 19795]
To date, several drugs
presently approved and prescribed to treat symptoms or slow
speciﬁc disease processes have shown the ability to also slow aging
in model systems. 

[CHUNK 19796]
Examples include Rapamycin, Metformin and
Acarbose. 

[CHUNK 19797]
The advantage of studying these medications is that
their safety for use in humans is already known. 

[CHUNK 19798]
Notable non-
FDA approved options also under current study, include 17α
-Estradiol (17α-E2), Fibroblast-growth factor-21 (FGF21), and
Resveratrol. 

[CHUNK 19799]
Further, interventions targeting the sirtuins, NAD
biosynthesis, amino acids, autophagy, and senescence pathways
have shown promise as well and are actively being investigated in
models of aging and health (Gonzalez-Freire et al., 2020).


[CHUNK 19800]
Rapamycin use is FDA approved for its immunosuppressive
and anti-graft rejection properties (Camardo, 2003). 

[CHUNK 19801]
However,
Rapamycin and other rapalogs have shown an ability to
increase lifespan in animal studies through inhibition of
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. 

[CHUNK 19802]
The
mTOR pathway is a metabolic regulator whose activation
is triggered by the insulin/IGF-1 axis, amino acid levels,
and glucose levels which all signal cellular energy status.


[CHUNK 19803]
Signals act through two multiprotein complexes (mTORC1
and mTORC2) and lead to diﬀerent outcomes. 

[CHUNK 19804]
In short,
mTORC1 activation leads to protein translation and cell growth,
whereas its inhibition blocks growth and induces stress response
pathways, such as autophagy, leading to pro-longevity eﬀects
(Laplante and Sabatini, 2012; Saxton and Sabatini, 2017).


[CHUNK 19805]
Pharmacological mTORC1 inhibition extends lifespan in mice
and involves multiple processes including autophagy, lipid
synthesis, mitochondrial metabolism, ribosomal biogenesis, and
modulation of the senescence-associated secretory phenotypes
(Pan and Finkel, 2017). 

[CHUNK 19806]
Contrarily, mTORC2 inactivation is
believed to be responsible for the unwanted insulin resistance
associated with rapamycin treatment (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017).


[CHUNK 19807]
Inhibition of mTORC1 occurs following both acute and chronic
administration of rapamycin while the unwanted inhibition of
mTORC2 requires long-term rapamycin treatment (Li J. et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 19808]
Thus, rapamycin and other rapalogs remain potential
candidates for use to interfere with aging processes and extend
health span.


[CHUNK 19809]
Metformin is another drug currently approved for use in
humans that has shown promising age-altering eﬀects in animal
studies. 

[CHUNK 19810]
Metformin is a safe biguanide-class drug used as the
ﬁrst line defense for type II diabetes in humans. 

[CHUNK 19811]
Its eﬀectiveness
in type II diabetes management comes from its ability to lower
hepatic glucose production and insulin resistance. 

[CHUNK 19812]
However,
there are reports that metformin use seems to oﬀer other health
beneﬁts, one of which is its anti-aging properties. 

[CHUNK 19813]
Administration
of metformin leads to caloric restriction-like beneﬁts such
as improved insulin sensitivity, AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) activity, and better antioxidant protection (Martin-
Montalvo et al., 2013). 

[CHUNK 19814]
Neonatal mice injected with a single
dose of metformin on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th days after birth
showed a signiﬁcant increase in lifespan for males and a slight
(non-signiﬁcant) increase in females (Anisimov et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19815]
In
both male and female neonatally-treated mice, hormonal and
metabolic serum testing was unaltered compared to control.


[CHUNK 19816]
However, metformin-treated males had decreased body weight
plus food and water consumption compared to control mice.


[CHUNK 19817]
Female treated mice showed no such diﬀerence compared to
controls (Anisimov et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19818]
Contrarily, administration of
metformin to 2-year-old male mice leads to improved health
without increased lifespan (Alfaras et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 19819]
Based on its
promising results from cellular and animal studies on aging and
its known safety in humans, a ground-breaking clinical trial
termed TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) is underway.


[CHUNK 19820]
TAME is the ﬁrst drug trial approved by the FDA that directly
targets aging. 

[CHUNK 19821]
The study plans to examine metformin’s ability
to delay age-related diseases beyond its eﬀects on glucose
metabolism through the study of 3,000 subjects across the U.S.


[CHUNK 19822]
between the ages of 65 to 79. 

[CHUNK 19823]
Results of TAME could have a
profound impact on the health care and research community.


[CHUNK 19824]
If metformin shows the ability to modulate aging and related
diseases, outside of its impact on diabetes, it would be the ﬁrst
step in the development of drugs speciﬁcally targeting the biology
of aging (Barzilai et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 19825]
Acarbose is an alpha-glucoside inhibitor used to treat
hyperglycemia and type II diabetes. 

[CHUNK 19826]
When consumed with a
carbohydrate-rich meal, acarbose competitively inhibits complex
carbohydrate breakdown along the brush border of the small
intestine resulting in delayed dietary carbohydrate breakdown
and absorption (Caspary and Graf, 1979). 

[CHUNK 19827]
Administration of
acarbose seems to have a positive impact on both short-term
and long-term blood glucose and insulin levels while also
receiving reports of decreased body weight in both animal
and human studies (Brewer et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 19828]
In animal studies,
acarbose administration leads to extended lifespan and improved
health-span particularly in male mice through an increase in
ﬁbroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) and a decrease in IGF-1
levels (Harrison et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 19829]
17α
-Estradiol
(17α-E2),
Fibroblast-growth
factor-21
(FGF21), and Resveratrol lack FDA approved use in humans
but studies of each have shown promise for an ability to curb
detrimental eﬀects of aging in mice. 

[CHUNK 19830]
17α-E2 is a non-feminizing
hormone found in humans whose administration in mice
leads to reduced body weight, extended lifespan, and mitigated
metabolic and age-related chronic inﬂammation. 

[CHUNK 19831]
However,
these eﬀects were limited to only male mice (Stout et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 19832]
Fibroblast-growth factor-21 (FGF21) is a protein hormone which
attenuates GH/IGF1 signaling in mice (Mendelsohn and Larrick,

[CHUNK 19834]
Transgenic overexpression of FGF21 leads to increased
lifespan (Zhang et al., 2012). 

[CHUNK 19835]
Finally, Resveratrol is a polyphenol
found in mulberries, peanuts, and red grapes. 

[CHUNK 19836]
Supplementation
of this polyphenol in monkeys has shown increased health while
supplementation in C. Elegans leads to increased lifespan. 

[CHUNK 19837]
There
have been mixed results in human studies (Gonzalez-Freire et al.,
2020). 

[CHUNK 19838]
Currently, there are new compounds being tested and
older drugs being repurposed for potential utilization to slow
aging processes and extend health in older persons, but more
studies are needed.


[CHUNK 19839]
DIET, ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND AGING
Since aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease,
one therapeutic tactic could be to investigate agents that slow
or delay aging processes and evaluate the impact on progression
of AD and related dementias (Figure 1). 

[CHUNK 19840]
Little research has
looked at the potential role of diet on AD progression. 

[CHUNK 19841]
There is
evidence for certain dietary practices, such as Mediterranean diet
(MD) and vitamin supplementation, oﬀering protection against
neurodegenerative disease development, but the eﬀects of dietary
intervention on the management of AD is relatively unknown
(Mendiola-Precoma et al., 2016; McGrattan et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19842]
A
few small clinical studies have showed a relationship between
ketogenic diet and improved cognition in AD patients (Rusek
et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19843]
These ﬁndings seem to be supported by studies
showing AD patients consistently exhibit reductions in cerebral
glucose utilization without alteration in brain ketone metabolism
(Castellano et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 19844]
More speciﬁcally, diet has been proposed to directly aﬀect
many of the underlying features of AD progression–including
amyloidogenesis, oxidative stress, and inﬂammation (Wu et al.,
2004; Gómez-Pinilla, 2008; Murphy et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19845]
Speciﬁc
components of diet have been heavily studied for their potential
role in the development and/or management of AD. 

[CHUNK 19846]
For
example, elevated levels of cholesterol cause increased amyloid
beta production through the increased activity of APP cleaving
enzymes γ-secretase and BACE1 as well as facilitating a
conformational change from a helical-rich Aβ structure to
an aggregation prone β-pleated sheet (Kakio et al., 2001;
Thirumangalakudi et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 19847]
Therapeutic
lowering of cholesterol via statin therapies has also shown an
association with decreased amyloid beta accumulation and AD
development (Shepardson et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19848]
However,
a gradual decline in serum cholesterol is typically seen with
dementias which shows the complexity of AD pathogenesis
(Mielke et al., 2010; Preseˇcki et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 19849]
Studies on fatty
acids have yielded contradicting results, but generally saturated
fats, trans-fats, and ω-6 fatty acids oﬀer no beneﬁt or may be
detrimental in the context of AD while ω-3 fatty acids have
demonstrated some potential beneﬁts (Liyanage et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 19850]
The association between a diet rich in carbohydrates and
AD progression is strong and there is speculation as to
whether altered glucose metabolism may be causative in AD.


[CHUNK 19851]
Consistently high levels of dietary sugars is linked with insulin
resistance, which has been proposed as a contributive factor
for AD development (Liyanage et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19852]
Interestingly,
brains of AD patients have shown decreased levels of the
glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3, which allow glucose
to cross the blood brain barrier and provide energy to the
CNS (Szablewski, 2017). 

[CHUNK 19853]
Decreased glucose delivery to the brain
leads to glucose starvation and stimulates AD neuropathologies,
vascular degeneration, and impaired cognition (Iadecola, 2015;
Winkler et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19854]
Additionally, proper insulin signaling,
which is disturbed in the AD brain, has also been suggested for
appropriate regulation of amyloid beta and tau proteins (Hong
and Lee, 1997; Qiu et al., 1998; Vekrellis et al., 2000; Planel
et al., 2007; El Khoury et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19855]
Insulin resistance also triggers
inﬂammation, which may worsen AD pathology (Creegan et al.,
2015).


[CHUNK 19856]
In general, alterations to dietary protein intake modiﬁes
lifespan. 

[CHUNK 19857]
Mice fed one-of-many diets varying in the ratio
of macronutrients and total energy content (as seen in the
Geometric Framework) found that those on low protein/high
carbohydrate (LPHC) diets had the greatest improvements
in longevity and metabolic health compared to all other
diets (Solon-Biet et al., 2014; Le Couteur et al., 2016). 

[CHUNK 19858]
In
humans, a national representative study of nutrition involving
a United States population (6,381 individuals aged 50 years
and over) found that individuals who got more of their dietary
calories from protein had signiﬁcantly increased risk of all-
cause cancer and cancer-related mortality. 

[CHUNK 19859]
Interestingly, this
relationship only applied to those under 66 years of age, as those
older showed reduction in all-cause mortality when getting more
of their calories from protein. 

[CHUNK 19860]
The protective eﬀect of increased
dietary protein found in the older group may be explained by
preventing sarcopenia and frailty development, which are more
commonly observed with increased age (Levine et al., 2014).


[CHUNK 19861]
The source of protein may also be important, as a large cohort
study reported an association between higher animal protein
consumption and increased risk of all-cause mortality, when
compared to plant-based protein intake (Song et al., 2016).


[CHUNK 19862]
Whether protein intake impacts AD directly is an area that
is underexplored.


[CHUNK 19863]
Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD) has been linked
with improved health outcomes. 

[CHUNK 19864]
Recent research is ﬁnding
that MD may also oﬀer cognitive and/or neurological beneﬁts
(Baumgart et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19865]
MD consists of a high intake in fruits,
vegetables, ﬁsh, nuts, monounsaturated fats, whole grains, and
legumes while limiting intake of red meat, saturated fats, dairy,
and reﬁned grains. 

[CHUNK 19866]
Results of many clinical trials have been
suggestive, but not deﬁnite, for MD having a protective eﬀect
on dementias and improved cognitive performance with aging
(Gardener and Caunca, 2018). 

[CHUNK 19867]
The mechanism through which
MD may be neuroprotective is not fully understood. 

[CHUNK 19868]
MD has
been shown to decrease rates of stroke and other vascular diseases
(such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes). 

[CHUNK 19869]
Vascular events are
associated with the development of dementia and may mediate
a connection between MD and neuroprotection. 

[CHUNK 19870]
Further, the
antioxidants and anti-inﬂammatory agents found in MD have
been hypothesized to play a protective role.

[CHUNK 19874]
DIETARY RESTRICTION AND NUTRIENT
SIGNALING
A common pathway involved in many interventions aimed
at slowing aging processes is the somatotropic axis. 

[CHUNK 19875]
Genetic
alterations to this axis have dramatic eﬀects on an organism’s
health and life span that is well-conserved evolutionarily. 

[CHUNK 19876]
For
example, low levels of growth hormone (GH) signaling, found
in both Ames dwarf and growth hormone receptor (GHR)
knockout mice, can extend the life of mice by over 50% (Brown-
Borg, 2016). 

[CHUNK 19877]
In humans with GHR deﬁciency and subsequent
decreased GH signaling as observed in Laron syndrome (LS),
protection from diabetes and fatal neoplasms occurs (Guevara-
Aguirre et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 19878]
Additionally, studies of centenarians have
found that low plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-
1) predict survival in these long-lived people (Milman et al.,
2014). 

[CHUNK 19879]
Currently there are several classes of compounds approved
for use in patients with acromegaly which inhibit the GH/IGF-
1 axis (Trainer et al., 2000; Giustina et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19880]
While these
therapeutics have not been studied for their eﬀects on aging and
health span in humans, their safety and the known eﬀects of
decreased GH/IGF-1 levels on the health span of mice shows a
promising area of future research (Longo et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 19881]
Many dietary interventions have been found to lower
signaling
through
the
GH/IGF
axis
and
thus
positively
impact health and lifespan. 

[CHUNK 19882]
Reduced mTOR signaling is also
frequently observed in models of extended lifespan from dietary
manipulation (Papadopoli et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 19883]
It has long been known
that diet impacts health in humans, but more recent work has
now found new connections between diet and aging. 

[CHUNK 19884]
The three
most common dietary interventions include caloric restriction
(CR), fasting, and methionine restriction. 

[CHUNK 19885]
Each have been shown
to increase lifespan in mice and will be discussed in further depth.


[CHUNK 19886]
Protocols for caloric restriction (CR; aka dietary restriction)
in rodents generally call for reduced total caloric intake by 20–
50% compared to ad libitum food administration (Vaughan et al.,
2018). 

[CHUNK 19887]
The following of these guidelines generally produces a
signiﬁcant increase in lifespan in mice. 

[CHUNK 19888]
However, further studies
have observed that mice of diﬀering genetic backgrounds are
aﬀected by CR diﬀerently. 

[CHUNK 19889]
42 diﬀerent recombinant inbred
strains of mice subjected to CR led to extended lifespan in
nine strains, signiﬁcantly reduced lifespan in four strains, and
no signiﬁcant change to 29 strains (Liao et al., 2010; Rikke
et al., 2010). 

[CHUNK 19890]
These results show a need for continued study
of the pathways relating diet to health and aging. 

[CHUNK 19891]
Current
understanding seems to indicate that CR’s beneﬁcial eﬀects
on aging work through the key nutrient and stress-responsive
metabolic signaling pathways including IIS/FOXO, mTOR,
AMPK, sirtuins, NRF2, and autophagy (Hwangbo et al., 2020).


[CHUNK 19892]
Application of CR to human studies has begun. 

[CHUNK 19893]
To an extent,
chronic CR has shown to be beneﬁcial to human health such
that moderate CR without malnutrition causes a protective eﬀect
against obesity, type II diabetes, inﬂammation, hypertension and
cardiovascular disease, all of which are major causes of morbidity,
disability and mortality (Fontana et al., 2004). 

[CHUNK 19894]
However, there
remains valid concerns against CR since the duration and severity
required for optimal health and anti-aging beneﬁts is not feasible
for most people over long periods of time and could lead to
undesirable side eﬀects (Longo et al., 2015).


[CHUNK 19895]
Dietary fasting has also been studied for its impact on health
and aging. 

[CHUNK 19896]
There are many forms of fasting but common types
include intermittent fasting (IF), which involves cycling between
ad libitum feeding and periods of fasting, and time restricted
fasting (TRF), in which food intake is limited to 6–12 h each
day without a change in the total calorie intake of the normal
diet (Hwangbo et al., 2020). 

[CHUNK 19897]
Model studies has shown IF to
lead to improved health with some reports of improved lifespan
as well (Goodrick et al., 1990; Honjoh et al., 2009; Catterson
et al., 2018; de Cabo and Mattson, 2019). 

[CHUNK 19898]
TRF has also shown
the potential to improve health and extend lifespan (Hwangbo
et al., 2020). 

[CHUNK 19899]
Compared to CR, the mechanisms relating fasting to
aging are not as well-understood and results from rodent studies
signify that IF and TRF eﬀects on aging act through diﬀering
pathways. 

[CHUNK 19900]
There have been proposed models, however, linking
CR and IF through common key metabolic pathways (such as
mTOR, IIS, and sirtuin) (Pan and Finkel, 2017). 

[CHUNK 19901]
One relatively
well-understood mechanism is that in the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, in which fasting causes the activation of the stress
resistance transcription factors Msn2/4 and Gis1 that regulate
many protective and metabolic genes (Wei et al., 2008). 

[CHUNK 19902]
In
general, though, fasting is believed to be a time in which the
organism activates alternative metabolic pathways which are
important for repair and health maintenance (fasting physiology)
(Longo and Panda, 2016). 

[CHUNK 19903]
IF and TRF allow the organism to
spend more time in this metabolic state which could contribute
to greater health and lifespan. 

[CHUNK 19904]
Human studies have found IF
and TRF to be safe and to have the ability to improve metabolic
health and physiological function, especially in obese individuals
(Hwangbo et al., 2020; Martens et al., 2020). 

[CHUNK 19905]
Yet, there are
still dangers accompanying fasting implementation in certain
populations of patients, especially those low in BMI, frail and old,
and patients with diabetes receiving insulin or insulin-like drugs.


[CHUNK 19906]
Although restrictions in total protein is associated with
increased health and lifespan, studies have found that restrictions
in speciﬁc amino acids (such as methionine or branched chain
amino acids) cause similar eﬀects. 

[CHUNK 19907]
The beneﬁts observed with
methionine restriction in mice are also like those seen with
CR (Brown-Borg, 2016). 

[CHUNK 19908]
The longevity beneﬁt of methionine
restriction relies on GH signaling, as in the absence of
GH signaling no lifespan extension is observed (Brown-Borg
et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19909]
Dietary amino acid levels are sensed by at least
two evolutionarily conserved mechanisms—mTOR and GCN2
(general control non-derepressible two). 

[CHUNK 19910]
The GCN2 pathway
becomes activated by the absence of many amino acids while
mTOR is activated by speciﬁc dietary amino acids (Li W. et al.,
2014).

[CHUNK 19913]
Pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1
extends lifespan in mice and reduced levels of methionine leads
to similar decreased activity in mTORC1 (Harrison et al., 2009).


[CHUNK 19914]
The conversion of methionine to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),
and the downstream SAM pathway, has been identiﬁed as the
link between methionine and mTORC1 signaling. 

[CHUNK 19915]
In short,
less dietary intake in methionine leads to decreased mTORC1
signaling and increased health and lifespan (Kitada et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 19916]
Importantly, mice on LPHC diets in the Geometric Framework
study showed low circulating branched chain amino acids which
correlated with decreased activation of hepatic mTOR (Solon-
Biet et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 19917]
This highlights mTOR as an important pathway
in regulating health and lifespan.


[CHUNK 19918]
Neurovascular coupling (NVC) disruptions and cerebral
microvasculature changes are also being studied as potential
targets for pharmacological therapies of the cognitive decline
typically seen with aging, but dietary intervention oﬀers
another avenue of research into this topic. 

[CHUNK 19919]
Increases in
ROS production (especially mitochondrial-derived) as well as
decreased production of oxidative stress protecting molecules,
such as antioxidants and anti-inﬂammatories, are associated
with vascular aging and disease (Ungvari et al., 2011, 2018,
2019; Springo et al., 2015). 

[CHUNK 19920]
Contrarily, elevated levels of
certain antioxidant enzymes, such as mitochondrial catalase,
are associated with protection of cerebral microvasculature and
the NVC mechanism in aging mice (Csiszar et al., 2019).


[CHUNK 19921]
As previously discussed, integration of dietary changes like
caloric restriction and fasting increase an organism’s stress
response pathways which are known for their anti-inﬂammatory
and health maintenance qualities. 

[CHUNK 19922]
This raises an interesting
question as to what role diet could have on maintenance and/or
improvement of NVC and cerebral microvasculature in older
adults and AD patients.


[CHUNK 19923]
CONCLUSION
Aging
is
a
major
risk
factor
for
the
development
of
neurodegenerative
diseases
such
as
Alzheimer’s
Disease
(AD). 

[CHUNK 19924]
Current therapeutic approaches toward the treatment of
AD have proved to be ineﬀective and emphasize the need for
alternative options. 

[CHUNK 19925]
Certain medications (such as Rapamycin
and Metformin) are intriguing because of their known safety in
humans as well as their ability to improve health and lifespan
in model organisms, but dietary interventions may be the
most feasible and yet understudied option. 

[CHUNK 19926]
Diet has long been
known to impact human health and following certain diets
(such as Mediterranean) is associated with decreased incidence
of neurodegenerative diseases as well as increased health and
lifespan. 

[CHUNK 19927]
Early ﬁndings from a few small studies show that
dietary changes (such as ketogenic diet) may be useful in the
management of AD. 

[CHUNK 19928]
However, much more work is needed
to examine the plausibility of dietary interventions for the
management of certain neurodegenerative diseases.

Background: Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, has
tremendous social and economic impact worldwide. 

[CHUNK 20771]
This study aimed to analyze
global trends in Alzheimer’s disease research and to investigate China’s contribution to
this research.


[CHUNK 20772]
Methods:
The quantity and inﬂuence of publications related to Alzheimer’s disease
in China and elsewhere were compared. 

[CHUNK 20773]
The Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed
databases were searched from 1988 to 2017 using the terms “Alzheimer’s disease”
or “Alzheimers disease.” Global Alzheimer’s disease publications were classiﬁed and
analyzed. 

[CHUNK 20774]
Keywords, countries, and institutions publishing articles on Alzheimer’s disease
were analyzed, and citations of these articles were examined.


[CHUNK 20775]
Results:
A total of 181,116 articles regarding Alzheimer’s disease research were
identiﬁed and analyzed. 

[CHUNK 20776]
Neuroscience and neurology were the main research categories
both globally and in China. 

[CHUNK 20777]
Basic research dominated Alzheimer’s publications,
accounting for 30.93% of global publications and 95.31% of publications in China.


[CHUNK 20778]
A total of 8,935 journals published articles related to Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 20779]
The
journal Neurobiology of Aging published the most Alzheimer’s disease-related articles,
numbering 5,206 over the time period examined. 

[CHUNK 20780]

Publication Trend of Alzheimer’s Disease
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) isa neuropathological disease involving
progressive neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 20788]
It initially impacts memory and
leads to progressive and irreversible cognitive decline and
functional impairment. 

[CHUNK 20789]
In 2010, an estimated 503,400 deaths of
Americans aged 75 years and older were attributed to AD (James
et al., 2014). 

[CHUNK 20790]
In Europe, a meta-analysis estimated the prevalence
and incidence of AD in Europe to be 5.05% and 11.08 per 1,000
person-years, respectively (Niu et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 20791]
With increasing
average life expectancy, AD is predicted to become a major
socioeconomic burden in the near future and is projected to
aﬀect 131.5 million people worldwide by 2050 (Khan et al., 2017).


[CHUNK 20792]
Despite advancements in understanding AD, its exact etiology
and pathogenesis remain unclear. 

[CHUNK 20793]
Over the past three decades,
our understanding of the mechanism of AD has increased and
methods for the diagnosis and treatment of AD have been
developed. 

[CHUNK 20794]
Simultaneously, scientiﬁc and technological strength
has developed in China. 

[CHUNK 20795]
However, global and China-speciﬁc
trends in AD research have not yet been described.


[CHUNK 20796]
Bibliometrics, an emerging ﬁeld of information science, is
useful for gaining insights into the intellectual structure of an
academic ﬁeld. 

[CHUNK 20797]
Bibliometric studies can identify hotspots in a
speciﬁc research area. 

[CHUNK 20798]
In addition, bibliometric analyses are often
used to identify academically signiﬁcant articles and landmark
publications. 

[CHUNK 20799]
Bibliometric analyses have been previously used to
investigate the research output of various ﬁelds at the global,
regional, and national levels, including neoplasms (Iqbal et al.,
2019), parasite (Goarant et al., 2019), pituitary adenoma (Guo
et al., 2018), and glioma (Burak Atci et al., 2019). 

[CHUNK 20800]
However, a
bibliometric study has not yet been conducted to understand the
landscape of AD.


[CHUNK 20801]
To evaluate the quantity and inﬂuence of global AD research,
a bibliometric analysis was performed over the time period of
1988 to 2017. 

[CHUNK 20802]
The present state and progress of AD research was
examined both globally and in China.


[CHUNK 20803]
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Searches were performed on November 26, 2018, using the Web
of Science (WOS) and PubMed databases. 

[CHUNK 20804]
China-related data
were derived from the latest National Natural Science Foundation
funding results query system (http://www.letpub.com.cn/index.


[CHUNK 20805]
php?-page=grant). 

[CHUNK 20806]
This study was not reviewed by an ethics
committee as it did not involve any human subjects and all data
are from public databases.

Search Strategy
A pilot search in the WOS database indicated that the search
term “Alzheimer’s disease” does not retrieve all publications
concerning
Alzheimer’s
disease.


[CHUNK 20809]
Consequently,
the
topic
(Alzheimer’s disease or Alzheimers disease) was searched
in the WOS database and results from 1988 to 2017 were
compiled. 

[CHUNK 20810]
This search included articles, reviews, proceedings,
meeting abstracts, and letters. 

[CHUNK 20811]
The PubMed database was
searched for (Mesh = Alzheimer’s disease) with publication
dates (1988/01/01–2017/12/31). 

[CHUNK 20812]
The document types retrieved
included clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, basic
research studies, and case reports. 

[CHUNK 20813]
In order to screen for basic
research, the species was identiﬁed as “other animals.” Two
researchers independently screened, sorted, and extracted
the data, with a third researcher participating in discussions
to reach consensus when necessary. 

[CHUNK 20814]
Bibliometric indicators,
including total number of publications, citation frequency,
citation frequency per article, h-index, research type, research
orientation, research organization, journal, and funding support
were extracted from the original data to quantitatively and
qualitatively analyze the publications.


[CHUNK 20815]
Maps Based on Bibliographic Data
The title, authors, countries, institutions, abstract, and keywords
of each article were extracted from the WOS database and
analyzed using VOSviewer (v.1.6.11). 

[CHUNK 20816]
For 1988, 1997, 2007,
and 2017, 12 term maps were produced to illustrate networks
of keywords, countries, and institutions, showing their co-
occurrence and relative citation impacts. 

[CHUNK 20817]
The methods and
algorithms of VOSviewer have been described in detail in
previous studies (van Eck and Waltman, 2017). 

[CHUNK 20818]
Aside from the
keywords map for 1988, keywords maps included keywords that
occurred at least 30 times under binary counting. 

[CHUNK 20819]
For institutions
maps, all research institutions were mapped for 1988 and the
top 1,000 research institutions in terms of total number of
publications were mapped for 1997, 2007, and 2017. 

[CHUNK 20820]
Countries
maps included all countries involved in AD research.


[CHUNK 20821]
Statistical Analysis
This study mainly used descriptive statistical analysis. 

[CHUNK 20822]
Trends
over the three decades were analyzed using linear regression.


[CHUNK 20823]
Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05. 

[CHUNK 20824]
SPSS statistical
software (version 21.0, IBM, New York, USA) was used for
data analysis.


[CHUNK 20825]
RESULTS
AD-Related Articles and Growth Trends
This study identiﬁed a total of 181,116 articles related to
AD published between 1988 and 2017. 

[CHUNK 20826]
The number of
publications regarding AD increased over time (R2 = 0.949,
P < 0.001), from 481 in 1988 to 14,976 in 2017 (Figure 1A).


[CHUNK 20827]
A total of 180 countries or territories participated in AD
research. 

[CHUNK 20828]
By country, the most articles were published from
the United States (71,319, 39.378%), followed by England
(15,903, 8.781%), China (14,068, 7.767%), Germany (13,024,
7.191%), Japan (11,703, 6.462%), and Italy (11,066, 6.110%)

(Figure 1B).


[CHUNK 20837]
As
Figure 1C
shows,
publications
regarding
AD from individual countries also increased over time:
United States (R2 = 0.986, P < 0.001), England (R2 = 0.929,
P < 0.001), China (R2 = 0.679, P < 0.001), Germany
(R2 = 0.976, P < 0.001), Japan (R2 = 0.952, P < 0.001),
and Italy (R2 = 0.949, P < 0.001).


[CHUNK 20838]
Strikingly, the number of AD-related publications from China
increased after 2008 (R2 = 0.972, P < 0.001) (Figure 1C).


[CHUNK 20839]
Among Chinese provinces and municipalities, Beijing published
the largest number of AD articles (Figure 1D).


[CHUNK 20840]
Citation and h-Index Analyses
The WOS database contained 1,712 highly cited articles related
to AD. 

[CHUNK 20841]
Figure 2A presents the 10 countries and territories
publishing the most highly cited articles. 

[CHUNK 20842]
The United States had
308,844 total citations and averaged 285.44 citations per item.


[CHUNK 20843]
The h-index for the United States was 313, higher than that for
any other country or territory. 

[CHUNK 20844]
Although China was ranked third
by the number of articles published, the total citations and h-
index of articles published in China (30,663 total citations, 271.35
citations per item and h-index of 80) were lower than those
observed for other developed countries.


[CHUNK 20845]
Literature on AD was published by about 49,836 diﬀerent
institutions from 1988 to 2017. 

[CHUNK 20846]
Figure 2B presents the 10
institutions contributing the most research globally over this time
frame. 

[CHUNK 20847]
Eight of these 10 institutions are in the United States
and the other two are in Canada (University of Toronto)
and Sweden (Karolinska Institute). 

[CHUNK 20848]
Harvard University was
the top contributor to AD research with 3,998 publications,
429,976 total citations, and an h-index of 289, followed by the
University of California at San Diego (2,654 articles, 223,686
total citations, h-index of 203), the University of Pennsylvania
(2,491 articles, 183,107 total citations, h-index of 191), and the
University of California, Los Angeles (2,475 articles, 182,475
total citations, h-index of 179). 

[CHUNK 20849]
The publications identiﬁed
5,607 scientiﬁc research institutions in China involved in AD-
related research. 

[CHUNK 20850]
Figure 2C details the 10 Chinese institutions
contributing the most publications to the ﬁeld. 

[CHUNK 20851]
The Chinese
Academy of Sciences was the top Chinese contributor to AD
research with 1,330 publications, 47,469 total citations, and an
h-index of 79, followed by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University
(643 articles, 20,080 total citations, h-index of 49), Capital
Medical University (613 articles, 16,090 total citations, h-index
of 43), and Fudan University (522 articles, 14,022 total citations,
h-index of 49). 

[CHUNK 20852]
While Chinese institutions are contributing
meaningful research to the AD ﬁeld, the top Chinese institutions
are not yet contributing to AD literature at the level of the top
global institutions.


[CHUNK 20853]
Study Category and Article Type Analyses
Globally, AD articles were categorized into 144 study types.


[CHUNK 20854]
As
shown
in
Figure 3A,
the
most
frequently
observed
categories were neuroscience/neurology with 84,864 articles
(46.856%),
followed
by
biochemistry/molecular
biology
with 25,769 articles (14.228%), geriatrics/gerontology with
22,620 articles (12.489%), psychiatry with 18,389 articles
(10.153%), and pharmacology/pharmacy with 18,154 articles
(10.023%). 

[CHUNK 20855]
As shown in Figure 3B, the ﬁrst several research
categories of Chinese AD literature do not diﬀer from
the top several categories globally. 

[CHUNK 20856]
The top ﬁve research
categories in China were neuroscience/neurology with 5,550
articles (39.451%), biochemistry/molecular biology with 2,219
articles (15.773%), pharmacology/pharmacy with 1,961 articles
(13.939%), chemistry with 1,671 articles (11.878%), and cell
biology with 1,066 articles (7.577%).


[CHUNK 20857]
In the past 30 years, according to the PubMed database
search, basic research accounted for 39,429 articles (30.93%),
and the proportion of this literature increased over time

Additionally,
2,786 case reports (2.19%), 4,077 clinical trials (3.20%), and
2,242 randomized controlled trials (1.76%) were published in the
AD ﬁeld. 

[CHUNK 20882]
In China, 3,884 basic research articles were published

articles. 

[CHUNK 20883]
The number of publications of each article type from
the United States far exceeded that of any other country or
territory, as shown in Figure 3D. 

[CHUNK 20884]
China has become the country
with the second largest total number of published AD articles;
however, Chinese articles contain much more basic research and
less clinical research compared to global publications.

Keywords, Country, and Institution Map
Analyses
Global keywords maps illustrating the co-occurrence network
of keywords for 1988, 1997, 2007, and 2017 are shown in
Figure 4A. 

[CHUNK 20886]
In 1988, AD-related research included only four
keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, amnesia, memory, and head
injury. 

[CHUNK 20887]
By 1997, the number of keywords had climbed to
4,137. 

[CHUNK 20888]
AD-related research had expanded to the protein
level and included topics such as acetylcholine, amyloid,
apoptosis,
amyloid
precursor
protein,
beta-amyloid,
and
apolipoprotein E. Additionally, relationships between AD and
neurodegeneration,
Parkinson’s
disease,
the
hippocampus,
and aging had been reported by 1997. 

[CHUNK 20889]
By 2007, the number
of keywords had increased to 10,713, including some of the
same keywords from previous decades such as dementia,
neurodegeneration,
aging,
hippocampus,
aging,
amyloid,
apoptosis, and beta-amyloid. 

[CHUNK 20890]
In addition, a series of new
keywords including oxidative stress, mild cognitive impairment,
tau, inﬂammation, microglia, neuroprotection, mitochondria,
MRI, schizophrenia, cholesterol, and diabetes had appeared, and
new pathophysiologic mechanisms of AD had been recognized.


[CHUNK 20891]
By 2017, the number of keywords had reached 22,641. 

[CHUNK 20892]
New
keywords had emerged such as acetylcholinesterase, alpha-
synuclein, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, functional connectivity,
blood–brain barrier, frontotemporal dementia, neuroimaging,
positron emission tomography, and biomarkers, reﬂecting
the enriched content of AD research. 

[CHUNK 20893]
New pathophysiologic
mechanisms have been recognized and functional neuroimaging
techniques have been gradually introduced to evaluate AD.


[CHUNK 20894]
In 1990, Chinese scholars described their AD research
investigating the prevalence of dementia and AD in Shanghai
in Annals of Neurology (Zhang et al., 1990). 

[CHUNK 20895]
Therefore, we
analyzed the keyword and institution maps for 1997, 2007, and
2017 in China, as shown in Figure 4B. 

[CHUNK 20896]
In 1997, AD research
in China covered 51 keywords, such as GABA, colchicine, 5-
HTT, allelic association, beta-amyloid, inﬂammation, caregiver-
stress, and dentate gyrus. 

[CHUNK 20897]
By 2007, AD-related research in
China was associated with 901 keywords, including apoptosis,
tau, beta-amyloid, amyloid precursor protein, neuroprotection,
oxidative stress, aggregation, hippocampus, and tea garden
soil. 

[CHUNK 20898]
By 2017, the number of keywords in China had reached
5,079, reﬂecting new keywords such as neurodegeneration, mild
cognitive impairment, nerve regeneration, meta-analysis, white
matter, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Kai Xin San,
molecular docking, and functional connectivity. 

[CHUNK 20899]
The relationship
between TCM and AD is characteristic of Chinese research.

Figure 5 shows the bibliographic network of countries and
regions in AD research in 1988, 1997, 2007, and 2017.

[CHUNK 20902]
Globally,
most institutions contributing to AD research are located in
the European Union and the United States (Figure 6A). 

[CHUNK 20903]
By
2017, the number of AD publications from China had increased
signiﬁcantly, and Chinese research institutes with a focus on AD
research had been established (Figures 6A,B).

Journal and Research Funding Agency
Analyses
A total of 8,935 journals published AD-related articles, and
1,966 journals published articles by Chinese researchers. 

[CHUNK 20905]
The
10 journals publishing the largest number of reports are
presented in Figure 7A. 

[CHUNK 20906]
Neurobiology of Aging was the most
active journal on AD research with 5,206 articles (2.874%),
followed by the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease with 4,873 articles
(2.691%), Neurology with 3,179 articles (1.755%), PLoS ONE
with 3,044 articles (1.681%), and Journal of Neurochemistry with
2,678 articles (1.479%). 

[CHUNK 20907]
The journals publishing the most AD
research from China were PLoS ONE with 450 articles (3.199%),
the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease with 447 articles (3.177%),
Neuroscience Letters with 354 articles (2.516%), Scientiﬁc Reports
with 232 articles (1.649%), and Molecular Neurobiology with
224 articles (1.592%), as shown in Figure 7B. 

[CHUNK 20908]
Globally, the
National Institutes of Health, the National Institute on Aging,
and the Department of Health and Human Services jointly
sponsored 11,809 articles, ranking ﬁrst in the world for funding
published AD research, as shown in Figure 7C. 

[CHUNK 20909]
In China, the
National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) funded
the most research, producing 6,128 articles (43.557%), as shown
in Figure 7D.


[CHUNK 20910]
Total NSFC funding and the number of AD research projects
funded in China have grown since 2008 (R2 = 0.914, P < 0.001;
R2 = 0.804, P < 0.001). 

[CHUNK 20911]
These correlational analysis results
are summarized in Figure 8A. 

[CHUNK 20912]
Among all Chinese research
institutions, Capital Medical University ranked ﬁrst for research
funding with 40 projects, totalling 33.97 million yuan, as shown
in Figure 8B. 

[CHUNK 20913]
In addition, funding for the study of TCM in the
AD ﬁeld has increased substantially since 2008, as shown in
Figure 8C. 

[CHUNK 20914]
Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine
ranked ﬁrst in AD research using TCM, with 11 projects and a
total funded amount of 5.2 million yuan, as shown in Figure 8D.

DISCUSSION
The present study provides a comprehensive overview of
the global development of AD research and summarizes the
contribution of China to AD research over the last three decades.


[CHUNK 20940]
In the past 30 years, the global volume of AD research has
increased tremendously. 

[CHUNK 20941]
A linear growth was observed in the
number of AD publications over the survey period, consistent
with publications in other neuroscience research ﬁelds (Yeung
et al., 2017a). 

[CHUNK 20942]
Most research originated in the United States,
highlighting that country’s important role in AD research. 

[CHUNK 20943]
Our
ﬁndings suggest that healthcare expenditures are substantially
related to the economic power of a country. 

[CHUNK 20944]
With its rapid growth
in science and technology, China has made great strides and now
holds a respectable position in AD research among developing
countries, but a gap still exists between China and developed
countries in terms of the academic level of AD research. 

[CHUNK 20945]
In
recent years, especially since 2008, the Chinese government
has supported the development of AD research: the number
of projects funded by NSFC has increased, and the amount of
funding from the NSFC has expanded. 

[CHUNK 20946]
At the same time, the lens
of TCM has been used to investigate the pathological mechanisms
and prevention of AD.


[CHUNK 20947]
Global AD research has developed appreciably, with 481
articles published in 1988 and 14,985 in 2017. 

[CHUNK 20948]
Based on
results of these studies, the pathological mechanisms of AD are
becoming more and more deﬁned, including the accumulation

of pathological misfolded tau (Leuzy et al., 2019), the amyloid-
β cascade hypothesis (Panza et al., 2019), circadian dysrhythmia
(Van Erum et al., 2018), gut microbiota (Jiang et al., 2017),
cholinergic neuron death and acetylcholine deﬁciency (Anand
et al., 2012), and chronic inﬂammation and oxidative stress
(Jaworski et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 20967]
In line with the mechanisms mentioned
above, drugs to treat AD have been developed to reduce tau
protein abnormalities, inhibit amyloid-β protein production,
treat circadian rhythm disorder, modulate the structure and
metabolism of gut microbiota, increase acetylcholine synthesis,
protect cholinergic neurons, and promote anti-inﬂammatory and
anti-oxidant compounds. 

[CHUNK 20968]
At present, there is no cure for AD;
treatments for AD only alleviate disease symptoms, and many
treatments are eﬀective in some AD patients for a limited time.


[CHUNK 20969]
Despite research eﬀorts, no disease-modifying treatments are
available and the underlying mechanisms of AD and optimal
treatment targets have not been fully elucidated.


[CHUNK 20970]
Early non-invasive examination tools such as transcranial
sonography (Favaretto et al., 2018) have been improved, and
functional neuroimaging techniques have been gradually applied
in AD research (Dennis and Thompson, 2014; delEtoile and
Adeli, 2017). 

[CHUNK 20971]
The overarching goals of AD research are to
determine when and how interventions can slow or stop
cognitive decline in patients, and to identify early signs of
decline and treatment response. 

[CHUNK 20972]
Phase II results of new
treatments and several therapies in phase III clinical trials are
encouraging. 

[CHUNK 20973]
Previous studies revealed that pathophysiological
changes of AD take place decades before clinical symptoms
of dementia appear (Morris, 2005). 

[CHUNK 20974]
This extended preclinical
phase of AD provides a critical opportunity for disease-
modifying agents to halt or slow the progression of AD
(Sperling et al., 2011). 

[CHUNK 20975]
We therefore optimistically anticipate
more eﬀective therapies in the foreseeable future. 

[CHUNK 20976]
Partnerships
between pharmacy, biotechnology, physics, chemistry, electronic
informatics, botany, and medicine are growing. 

[CHUNK 20977]
These will enable
treatments with a range of targets to be developed, with an
emphasis on drug repositioning and novel drug discovery.


[CHUNK 20978]
More investment is urgently needed to enable more treatments
to be studied in clinical trials. 

[CHUNK 20979]
Some form of preventative
treatment strategy, possibly specialized combination therapies
with multiple targets, may be available in the next decade.

Review
851
Being published in such well-established journals might have
allowed these articles to accumulate a large number of citations,
consistent with suggestions from a previous neuroscience study
(Yeung et al., 2017b). 

[CHUNK 21033]
By contrast, citations can have a snowball
eﬀect, since articles with higher impact factors are likely to be
cited more often (Lefaivre et al., 2011; Yeung et al., 2017b). 

[CHUNK 21034]
These
highly cited articles should be familiar to every AD researcher
and are critical for understanding the key messages in this ﬁeld.


[CHUNK 21035]
Large clusters in keyword co-occurrence networks indicate
important
research hotspots.


[CHUNK 21036]
Worldwide,
the number
of
keywords in AD-related literature has grown from 4 in 1988 to
22,641 in 2017, illustrating the enriched content of this research.


[CHUNK 21037]
Popular research topics include beta-amyloid, tau, aging, the
hippocampus, neurodegeneration, apoptosis, neuroprotection,
neuroinﬂammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. 

[CHUNK 21038]
These
represent good choices for strong AD research teams but may be
risky for less established research teams owing to the diﬃculty
of securing funding and making research breakthroughs in these
relatively underdeveloped areas. 

[CHUNK 21039]
Less developed research areas
include neuroimaging, functional connectivity, iron, reactive
oxygen species, alpha-synuclein, proteostasis, phytochemicals,
homocysteine, voxel-based morphometry, angiogenesis, and
sleep. 

[CHUNK 21040]
Dynamic research trends can be observed to understand
changes in the clustering network and to make informed
decisions on research directions. 

[CHUNK 21041]
Regardless, each of these areas
helps to improve our understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanisms of AD.


[CHUNK 21042]
Despite changes in research topics, the countries and institutes
producing the most AD literature did not change signiﬁcantly
between 1988 and 2017. 

[CHUNK 21043]
The United States, Canada, Japan,
Australia, and European Union countries continue to be major
contributors to AD research. 

[CHUNK 21044]
Remarkably, these countries were
previously identiﬁed as major contributors to neuroscience
research (Yeung et al., 2017a), indicating that these countries
and their institutes occupy core positions in global research.


[CHUNK 21045]
Prior to 2008, AD research in China was progressing slowly.


[CHUNK 21046]
Since 2008, Chinese AD research has grown substantially. 

[CHUNK 21047]
A
possible explanation for this is that the Chinese government
established the Central Coordination Group for Talents Work
and implemented the Recruitment Program of Global Experts in
2008. 

[CHUNK 21048]
By 2018, the program has attracted about 6,000 Chinese
scientists, entrepreneurs, and scholars living abroad to return
to China. 

[CHUNK 21049]
Another possible explanation for this growth is the
increased ﬁnancial aid to AD research and the enhanced funding
system for AD research. 

[CHUNK 21050]
Together, these results provide insights
into the importance of both talent and ﬁnancial support for
developing scientiﬁc research. 

[CHUNK 21051]
The economic power of a country
has a direct bearing on its medical research expenditures (Zhang
et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2018). 

[CHUNK 21052]
In recent years, China’s economic
power has grown rapidly and the country has become the world’s
second-biggest economy. 

[CHUNK 21053]
This could greatly boost AD research
in China. 

[CHUNK 21054]
The NSFC, with 18 sponsor systems covering all
scientiﬁc subjects, is a bellwether of scientiﬁc research grants
in China. 

[CHUNK 21055]
In addition to support for local scientiﬁc researchers,
the NSFC also provides substantial support to international
collaborative projects and Chinese scientists returning from
overseas studies. 

[CHUNK 21056]
Beyond the China-wide funding system, the
country has established a medical research funding system at
the provincial, municipal, and district levels, with funds such
as the Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation, and the
Qingdao Municipal Source Innovation Project Fund. 

[CHUNK 21057]
Thanks
to these policies and funding systems, a large number of
outstanding scholars have returned to China and have promoted
AD research because of the concepts, techniques, international
academic exchanges, and collaborations they bring with them.


[CHUNK 21058]
Additionally, the huge population base in China provides an
unparalleled advantage for AD clinical research. 

[CHUNK 21059]
According
to data from the Sixth Census of China’s National Bureau
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

[CHUNK 21060]
Dong et al.


[CHUNK 21061]
Publication Trend of Alzheimer’s Disease
of Statistics (2010), 13.26% of China’s population is over 60
years old; according to the Statistical Bulletin of Social Services
Development published by the Ministry of Civil Aﬀairs in 2016,
16.7% of China’s population is over 60 years old. 

[CHUNK 21062]
It estimated that,
by 2030, the proportion of the total population over 60 years
old will exceed 20% of the total population. 

[CHUNK 21063]
So far, researchers
in China have relatively low output in clinical trials and
randomized controlled trials compared to basic research. 

[CHUNK 21064]
This is
largely due to the NSFC principally supporting basic scientiﬁc
research. 

[CHUNK 21065]
Clinical study of AD in China has great potential,
and platforms for clinical cooperation, databases, and analysis
systems should be planned to unite and integrate this massive
clinical potential.


[CHUNK 21066]
However, the gap between China and leading countries in
AD research cannot be ignored. 

[CHUNK 21067]
While the total number of AD
articles from China has increased dramatically in recent years, the
citation frequency and h-index remain low. 

[CHUNK 21068]
In terms of research
types, Chinese publications are highly focused on basic research,
and in earlier years, Chinese AD research lagged behind global
AD research. 

[CHUNK 21069]
For example, in 1988, no AD-related research was
published in China; in 1997, apoptosis and neurodegeneration
appeared on global keywords co-occurrence maps, while these
keywords only appeared on China’s keywords co-occurrence
maps in 2007. 

[CHUNK 21070]
Studies associated with MRI and schizophrenia
were conducted globally in 2007, but these keywords only
appeared in China’s keywords co-occurrence maps in 2017. 

[CHUNK 21071]
Only
one Chinese research institute has entered the top 80 global
institutions contributing to AD research. 

[CHUNK 21072]
In our bibliometric
analysis, China’s scientiﬁc research institutions impacted the
world institutions map only in 2017. 

[CHUNK 21073]
There are few AD-related
international journals in China; creation of several international
AD-related journals might attract submissions and encourage
academic exchange. 

[CHUNK 21074]
Finally, TCM research provides a unique
opportunity for AD research in China. 

[CHUNK 21075]
TCM has been prescribed
in the Chinese community for more than 2000 years, and
many herbal compounds are regarded as promising anti-AD
drugs (Howes et al., 2017). 

[CHUNK 21076]
However, unknown molecular targets
and mechanisms, incorrect dosage, and high toxicity of herbal
concoctions due to their complex formulations have hindered
the therapeutic development of TCM. 

[CHUNK 21077]
Chinese researchers
could achieve breakthroughs in pharmacological research in
TCM, eventually developing TCM as alternative medicines to
modulate AD.


[CHUNK 21078]
The
bibliometric
analysis had some
limitations.


[CHUNK 21079]
First,
bibliometric analyses cannot necessarily measure the validity
of or the scientiﬁc quality of publications and instead must
focus on the impact of the research. 

[CHUNK 21080]
A highly cited publication
may not necessarily be of high scientiﬁc quality. 

[CHUNK 21081]
An article’s
citation count depends on a variety of factors, including journal
type, research model, and self-citing rate. 

[CHUNK 21082]
Second, delayed
publication collections from the WOS and PubMed databases
could also cause bias in the study. 

[CHUNK 21083]
Third, the WOS and
PubMed databases mainly included literature written in English,
excluding many non-English publications. 

[CHUNK 21084]
Fourth, the WOS and
PubMed databases classify literature types diﬀerently, so the
literature identiﬁed from diﬀerent databases cannot be compared
mechanically. 

[CHUNK 21085]
Readers should note these confounding factors
when interpreting the results from the present study.


[CHUNK 21086]
CONCLUSIONS
The current study provides a comprehensive perspective on
AD research and illustrates that this is a well-developed and
promising research ﬁeld. 

[CHUNK 21087]
The most frequent study category
was neuroscience/neurology. 

[CHUNK 21088]
Neurobiology of Aging was the
journal publishing the most AD research. 

[CHUNK 21089]
Research institutes
and research funding agencies from North America and Europe
constitute the core research forces, and the United States
contributed
the
most
publications.


[CHUNK 21090]
Although,
China
has
gradually become a critical force in AD research, China still lacks
high-level research institutions and literature. 

[CHUNK 21091]
This bibliometric
analysis can guide future research and serve as an educational
guide for trainees.

Background: Alzheimer’s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease, and 
patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (onset age < 65 years) often have 
atypical symptoms, which are easily misdiagnosed and missed. 

[CHUNK 21250]
Multimodality 
neuroimaging has become an important diagnostic and follow-up method for 
AD with its non-invasive and quantitative advantages.


[CHUNK 21251]
Case presentation: We report a case of a 59-year-old female with a diagnosis 
of depression at the age of 50 after a 46-year-old onset and a 9-year follow-
up observation, who developed cognitive dysfunction manifested by memory 
loss and disorientation at the age of 53, and eventually developed dementia. 


[CHUNK 21252]
Combined with neuropsychological scales (MMSE and MOCA scores decreased 
year by year and finally reached the dementia criteria) and the application of 
multimodal imaging. 

[CHUNK 21253]
MRI showed that the hippocampus atrophied year by year 
and the cerebral cortex was extensively atrophied. 

[CHUNK 21254]
18F-FDG PET image showed 
hypometabolism in right parietal lobes, bilateral frontal lobes, bilateral joint 
parieto-temporal areas, and bilateral posterior cingulate glucose metabolism. 

[CHUNK 21255]
The 
18F-AV45 PET image showed the diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease 
was confirmed by the presence of Aβ deposits in the cerebral cortex.


[CHUNK 21256]
Conclusion: Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, which starts with depression, 
often has atypical symptoms and is prone to misdiagnosis. 

[CHUNK 21257]
The combination of 
neuropsychological scales and neuroimaging examinations are good screening 
tools that can better assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.

[CHUNK 21266]
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and 
the most common type of dementia, accounting for about 60 to 80% 
(1). 

[CHUNK 21267]
This disease is commonly seen in elderly people over 65 years of 
age, with memory impairment and psychobehavioral abnormalities as 
the main clinical manifestations (2). 

[CHUNK 21268]
Magnetic resonance imaging of 
the head shows atrophy of the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex, 
increased width of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, and 
atrophy of the internal olfactory cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus 
(3). 

[CHUNK 21269]
The main pathological manifestations of AD are characterized by 
plaques formed by extracellular amyloid (Aβ) aggregates and 
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by abnormal intracellular tau 
protein phosphorylation aggregates (4).


[CHUNK 21270]
In recent years, studies have found that the pathological changes 
in AD begin 15 years before the onset of clinical symptoms and that 
irreversible damage to the nervous system has usually occurred by the 
time the diagnosis is made (5). 

[CHUNK 21271]
Mild cognitive impairment is often 
considered to be a precursor stage of AD, and epidemiological surveys 
show that approximately 10 to 15% of patients with MCI develop AD 
every year, which is significantly higher than the 1 to 2% conversion 
rate of AD in normal aging (6). 

[CHUNK 21272]
Recently, there has been a gradual 
increase in reports of early onset AD (EOAD) starting under the age 
of 65, which is estimated to account for about 5 to 10% of AD (7). 


[CHUNK 21273]
However, the diagnosis of EOAD is more difficult, often takes longer 
from onset to diagnosis, and requires the use of more imaging and 
laboratory tests to find evidence of pathological changes to support 
the AD diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 21274]
Therefore, early recognition of AD is particularly 
important for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.


[CHUNK 21275]
So far, with the development of molecular imaging, differential 
diagnosis can be made from multiple perspectives, such as structure, 
function, and pathology. 

[CHUNK 21276]
In 2018, the National Institute on Aging and 
Alzheimer’s Disease (NIA-AA) proposed a biomarker-based “ATN” 
research framework (7). 

[CHUNK 21277]
(A) refers to a positive brain Aβ-PET image; 
(T) refers to a positive Tau-PET image; and (N) is a brain 18F-FDG 
PET with hypometabolism and/or brain atrophy on MRI. 

[CHUNK 21278]
Not only 
can 18F-FDG PET imaging distinguish AD patients from normal 
elderly people, but it can also identify patients at risk of progression 
to AD from MCI patients, with sensitivities and specificities of 70 and 
90%, respectively (8). 

[CHUNK 21279]
In addition, 18F-FDG PET can be  used to 
identify APOE4 gene carriers. 

[CHUNK 21280]
A study of 18F-FDG PET imaging in 
209 APOE4 carriers and controls found that APOE4 gene carriers had 
age-independently decreased metabolism in the posterior cingulate 
gyrus and parietal lobe (9). 

[CHUNK 21281]
The typical pattern of glucose metabolism 
in AD is bilateral temporoparietal hypometabolism, with progressive 
hypometabolism in the frontal lobe but without involvement of areas 
associated with sensation and movement (10).


[CHUNK 21282]
Currently, research has shown that amyloid imaging is the best 
choice for the early diagnosis of AD. 

[CHUNK 21283]
Amyloid PET can provide 
neuropathological information. 

[CHUNK 21284]
As one of the main pathological 
markers of AD, the non-invasive, in vivo detection of amyloid plaques 
has a very high sensitivity and specificity (11). 

[CHUNK 21285]
A meta-analysis 
assessing amyloid PET to predict conversion of mild cognitive 
impairment to Alzheimer’s disease showed a sensitivity of 93% (95% 
CI 73.1–99.9) and a specificity of 56% (47.2–65.8) (12). 

[CHUNK 21286]
Thus, 
appropriate criteria for the use of amyloid PET have been proposed in 
the literature, identifying the following patient groups that are most 
likely to benefit from the test: patients with uncertainly mild cognitive 
impairment in the clinical setting; patients with dementia syndromes 
suggestive of Alzheimer’s disease but within atypical or suspected 
mixed etiologies; and patients with early-onset progressive cognitive 
decline (13). 

[CHUNK 21287]
Although it cannot distinguish between amyloidosis 
diseases, and even some elderly people are positive, a negative test can 
rule out AD (14).


[CHUNK 21288]
However, patients with AD not only have altered molecular 
metabolism but also changes in brain structure and function. 


[CHUNK 21289]
Fortunately, PET/MRI allows simultaneous acquisition of molecular 
imaging as well as structural and functional imaging data, reducing 
operative time and improving patient compliance. 

[CHUNK 21290]
Thanks to the 
development of multimodal MRI, resting-state functional MRI can

be  used to examine functional connectivity to look for specific 
patterns of functional activation, which can differentiate AD from 
disorders with similar clinical symptoms (15). 

[CHUNK 21293]
Several studies 
combined functional connectivity with a structural approach, 
suggesting that structural abnormalities may be  responsible for 
abnormal functional connectivity in diseases (16, 17).


[CHUNK 21294]
As we all know, the default mode network (DMN) participates in 
cognitive processes such as situational memory, introspection, and 
emotion. 

[CHUNK 21295]
In addition, the DMN is divided into the anterior DMN 
(medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate 
gyrus, lateral temporal lobe, etc.) 

[CHUNK 21296]
and the posterior DMN (ventral 
prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, 
angular gyrus, hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, etc.) 

[CHUNK 21297]
(18). 

[CHUNK 21298]
A study 
of resting FDG-PET/fMRI data was conducted to investigate changes 
in the DMN subsystem in AD patients, functional connectivity and 
glucose metabolism were significantly reduced in patients with post-
DMN, and the strength of functional connectivity in pDMN patients 
was positively correlated with the overall cognitive status of AD 
patients (19). 

[CHUNK 21299]
Through PET and rs-fMRI studies, it was found that Aβ 
is first deposited in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and 
temporoparietal regions in MCI, reducing functional connectivity 
between these regions and other brains and thus affecting the 
functional integrity of the DMN (20). 

[CHUNK 21300]
The frontoparietal network 
(FPN) plays an important role in the regulation of behavior and the 
development of complex plans (21). 

[CHUNK 21301]
The executive control network 
(ECN) plays an important role in the management and control of 
high-level cognition such as attention, decision-making, and working 
memory (22). 

[CHUNK 21302]
A study using MCI patients as subjects found that the 
left FPN was positively correlated with the connectivity of the DMN, 
ECN, and memory storage in MCI (23). 

[CHUNK 21303]
All in all, the above studies 
suggest that the impairment of specific functional networks underlies 
the clinical symptoms of AD, and that diminished regulatory effects 
lead to an overall impairment of cognitive function.


[CHUNK 21304]
Depression has the potential to develop into dementia, and the 
potential relationship requires more research on the pathogenesis of 
depression and dementia. 

[CHUNK 21305]
Current research suggests that chronic 
low-grade inflammation is associated with neurodegenerative diseases 
and psychiatric disorders, which may be a key point in connecting the 
pathogenesis of both (24). 

[CHUNK 21306]
Because depression is associated with 
reduced levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine in vivo, most research has 
focused on the field of the serotonin pathways, but people are 
increasingly focusing on the KYN pathway, which produces various 
bioactive compounds related to inflammation, the immune system, 
the nervous system, and psychiatric disorders (25, 26). 

[CHUNK 21307]
Moreover, 
several studies have shown that the tryptophan-kynurenine (TRP-
KYN) metabolic pathway is closely associated with the immune 
regulation of depression and Alzheimer’s disease (27–29). 

[CHUNK 21308]
Indeed, 
tryptophan is not only the main raw material for the synthesis of 
5-hydroxytryptamine, it can also be  degraded into several other 
neuroactive compounds, mainly kynurenine, kynurenic acid, which 
has neuroprotective effects, and quinine phosphate, which can cause 
degeneration of hippocampal neurons.


[CHUNK 21309]
Recently, it has been reported that low levels of TRP are 
associated with AD, and supplementation with tryptophan can 
enhance cognitive function (30). 

[CHUNK 21310]
Besides, another study suggests 
that KYNA has an antidepressant-like effect and that KYNA 
analogues are potential anti dementia agents (31). 

[CHUNK 21311]
A previous study 
indicated that KP metabolites were highly correlated with 
biomarkers of neurofibrillary tau pathology, neuroinflammation, 
and neurodegeneration, suggesting that dysregulated KP 
metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD (32). 

[CHUNK 21312]
In 
addition, a meta-analysis showed that TRP, KYN, and KYNA levels 
were decreased, KYN/TRP ratios were increased, and KYNA/KYN, 
KYNA/QA, and KYNA/3-HK ratios were decreased in patients with 
major depression (33). 

[CHUNK 21313]
There are many other studies that have 
demonstrated the importance of KYN system activation in 
depression (34, 35). 

[CHUNK 21314]
Thus, dysregulation of the TRP-KYN pathway, 
leading to increasing or decreasing neuroactive metabolites, is 
closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease and depression (29, 36).


[CHUNK 21315]
Now a case of a patient initially diagnosed with depression and 
finally diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease after 9 years of 
follow-up observation is reported below.


[CHUNK 21316]
2. 

[CHUNK 21317]
Case description
A 59-year-old female patient in junior high school began illness 
in 2010. 

[CHUNK 21318]
After a family conflict, she felt sadness, decreased interest, 
self-blame, worry, concern, always thinking badly, panic, chest 
tightness, overall pain, dry mouth, loss of appetite, abdominal 
distention, and belching. 

[CHUNK 21319]
Accompanied by sleep disturbances, 
manifested by difficulty in falling asleep, easy waking up at night, 
dreaminess, and difficulty in falling asleep after waking. 

[CHUNK 21320]
Unfortunately, 
she did not see a doctor or get any remedy at that time.


[CHUNK 21321]
In December 2014, she came to our hospital and felt that being 
alive was meaningless, what’s more, she had suicidal thoughts and was 
lazy to say and move. 

[CHUNK 21322]
Besides, she did not like to do housework and 
even did not wash her face. 

[CHUNK 21323]
Blood routine, biochemical liver function, 
kidney function, electrolytes, thyroid function, urinary routine, 
hepatitis virus, syphilis, and HIV were normal. 

[CHUNK 21324]
No abnormality was 
found on the MRI examination of the head. 

[CHUNK 21325]
The patient had a previous 
history of psoriasis spanning more than 20 years. 

[CHUNK 21326]
Allergy to painkillers 
and fish. 

[CHUNK 21327]
She denied a history of hypertension, diabetes, 
cerebrovascular disease, and heart disease. 

[CHUNK 21328]
No history of surgery or 
trauma. 

[CHUNK 21329]
No history of attraction or alcohol consumption. 

[CHUNK 21330]
Denied the 
history of hereditary disease, infectious disease. 

[CHUNK 21331]
We have a diagnosis 
of “depression,” and antidepressant treatment with duloxetine 
hydrochloride. 

[CHUNK 21332]
Initially, outpatient visits were conducted every 
2 weeks, but then they were changed to outpatient visits every 4 weeks. 


[CHUNK 21333]
The above symptoms were completely relieved, and life functions 
were restored.


[CHUNK 21334]
In July 2017, there was another negative life event; she experienced 
depression, decreased interest, reduced volitional behavior, and the 
idea of suicide reappeared. 

[CHUNK 21335]
Memory loss occurs for the first time, such 
as forgetting to put salt in cooking. 

[CHUNK 21336]
MMSE scale: 23 points. 

[CHUNK 21337]
MOCA 
scale: 20 points. 

[CHUNK 21338]
No abnormalities on head MRI.


[CHUNK 21339]
In March 2018, the patient was followed up with a partial 
resolution of emotional symptoms and no improvement in memory. 


[CHUNK 21340]
The MMSE scale and the MOCA scale were administered and there 
was no significant change in the scores. 

[CHUNK 21341]
No abnormalities on head.


[CHUNK 21342]
In November 2020, the follow-up continued, there was a delay in 
thinking, irritability, and being unable to control her temper. 

[CHUNK 21343]
MMSE 
23 points and MOCA 17 points.

In March 2022, the patient had significantly worse memory loss, 
slowed thinking, and was unable to do housework. 

[CHUNK 21347]
MMSE 19 points, 
MOCA 12 points. 

[CHUNK 21348]
The MRI showed signs of brain atrophy. 

[CHUNK 21349]
Following 
up with her family members, the patient has not taken her medication 
regularly since 2021. 

[CHUNK 21350]
We readjusted the dosage of the medication and 
advised her to take it on time.


[CHUNK 21351]
In February 2023, the patient had worsened memory loss due to 
recent events, disorientation, and personality changes, such as 
forgetting what she ate for breakfast and moving around the house in 
the wrong direction. 

[CHUNK 21352]
More seriously, the patient used to be frugal but 
now often buys things she does not need. 

[CHUNK 21353]
MMSE 14 points. 

[CHUNK 21354]
MOCA 
12 points. 

[CHUNK 21355]
PET/MRI showed brain atrophy in the bilateral 
hippocampus, right amygdala, bilateral frontal, temporal, occipital, 
and right parietal lobes. 

[CHUNK 21356]
DWI and SWI did not show any abnormal 
signals. 

[CHUNK 21357]
The 18F-FDG image showed decreased glucose metabolism 
in the right parietal lobe, bilateral partial lobe, bilateral frontal lobe, 
bilateral parietotemporal joint region, and bilateral partial posterior 
cingulate gyrus. 

[CHUNK 21358]
The 18F-AV45 PET image showed Aβ deposition was 
present in the cerebral cortex. 

[CHUNK 21359]
Finally, we diagnose Alzheimer’s disease.


[CHUNK 21360]
Adjusting the medication venlafaxine 150 mg to improve mood, 
gradually add memantine 5 mg to 10 mg, then 5 mg in the morning 
and 10 mg at night. 

[CHUNK 21361]
During a follow-up visit 2 weeks after discharge, 
the patient’s family reported that the patient had increased daytime 
sleep when taking 15 mg, so it was adjusted to 15 mg at night to 
alleviate daytime sleepiness.


[CHUNK 21362]

[CHUNK 21363]
Diagnostic
The improvement in the patient’s depression and anxiety 
symptoms after treatment can be  seen in Figure  1A. 

[CHUNK 21364]
However, 
symptoms of cognitive dysfunction progressively worsened over time. 


[CHUNK 21365]
Signs of brain atrophy appear on imaging tests 10 years after the onset 
of the disease. 

[CHUNK 21366]
Figure 1B shows a year-to-year decline in visuospatial/
executive function, delayed memory, attention, and orientation in. 


[CHUNK 21367]
Studies have found that delayed memory impairment in Alzheimer’s 
disease patients is a characteristic hallmark of the disease and is 
primarily related to hippocampal function (37). 

[CHUNK 21368]
It was found that 
hippocampal atrophy is a valid predictor of whether MCI converts to 
AD, and the more hippocampal atrophy in MCI patients, the higher 
the rate of conversion to AD (37).


[CHUNK 21369]
As shown in Figure 2A, the patient’s hippocampal, amygdala, 
occipital, temporal, and insula brain area volumes have gradually 
decreased over the last 3 years, consistent with the literature (38). 


[CHUNK 21370]
There was an overall fluctuating decrease in the volume of brain 
regions in the posterior cingulate gyrus. 

[CHUNK 21371]
In Figure 2B①–③, the visual 
analysis of the coronal scan showed no significant atrophy in the 
hippocampal region of the patient. 

[CHUNK 21372]
As shown in Figure 2B④–⑥, the 
patient did not show any significant signs of brain atrophy on MRI 
follow-up from 2014.12 to 2018.3. 

[CHUNK 21373]
As shown in Figure 2B⑦–⑨, the 
patient’s MRI from 2020.3 to 2023.2 showed signs of brain atrophy, 
and the degree of atrophy gradually increased.


[CHUNK 21374]
After 3 years of treatment, the patient’s depressive symptoms were 
partially improved. 

[CHUNK 21375]
Dramatically, during the treatment follow-up, it 
was found that the patient was indifferent, her family complained of 
her being unable to find home, her memory was reduced, she was 
unable to cook, and chronic cognitive symptoms such as memory and 
executive function gradually came to the fore. 

[CHUNK 21376]
While emotional 
symptoms improved during treatment, cognitive symptoms did not. 


[CHUNK 21377]
We performed an MRI examination and found no abnormalities in 
the blood routine, glutathione, glutamic aminotransferase, creatinine, 
and immune-related indicators. 

[CHUNK 21378]
Apart from cerebrovascular diseases, 
there was no evidence for dementia symptoms in nutritional and 
metabolic diseases. 

[CHUNK 21379]
There were no visual hallucinations, no RBD, and 
no basis for the dementia with Lewy body. 

[CHUNK 21380]
Moreover, there is 
insufficient evidence for slow onset and gradual progression, such as 
in CJD and autoimmune brain disease. 

[CHUNK 21381]
There is no history of fever and 
infection, and there is no evidence of infectious diseases such as 
encephalitis. 

[CHUNK 21382]
The current evidence is more supportive of 
neurodegenerative diseases, and the possibility of frontotemporal 
dementia needs to be considered. 

[CHUNK 21383]
However, the clinical manifestations 
of frontotemporal dementia are progressive impairments of behavior, 
executive function, and language, while memory impairment is often 
not significant. 

[CHUNK 21384]
Only symptoms and signs alone are sometimes 
difficult to identify, so imaging studies are performed.


[CHUNK 21385]
The MRI structural imaging showed hippocampal and cortical 
atrophy, 18F-FDG imaging suggested hypometabolism in the parietal, 
temporal, and posterior cingulate gyrus (Figure 3A), and 18F-AV45 
imaging suggested significant cortical Aβ deposition (Figure 3B), 
which is consistent with the imaging manifestations of Alzheimer’s 
disease (39). 

[CHUNK 21386]
In contrast, patients with frontotemporal dementia show 
hypometabolism in the frontal and prefrontal lobes, and as the disease 
progresses, the involved area expands to the parietal and temporal 
lobes, subcortical basal ganglia area, and the thalamus, and has 
negative or mildly elevated Aβ imaging deposits, so it can be excluded 
(40). 

[CHUNK 21387]
The areas of hypometabolism in dementia with Lewy body 
mostly involve the occipital lobe (41).


[CHUNK 21388]
4. 

[CHUNK 21389]
Discussion
The patient, who started with depressive symptoms at the age of 
46, developed memory impairment after 7 years of follow-up. 

[CHUNK 21390]
Then, 
imaging changes were found 10 years later, and a diagnosis of EOAD 
was made 13 years later. 

[CHUNK 21391]
It is reported that the prevalence of EOAD is 
about 24.2/100000, and the annual incidence rate is about 6.3/100000 
(42). 

[CHUNK 21392]
Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in 
AD patients, and it is also a risk factor for the onset of AD. 

[CHUNK 21393]
Between 
20 and 40% of AD patients experience depression, which often occurs 
early in the disease. 

[CHUNK 21394]
Patients with early-onset AD are more likely to 
develop depression than those with late-onset AD due to significant 
changes in lifestyle, roles, and responsibilities, as well as poor social 
adaptability (43). 

[CHUNK 21395]
More and more studies have shown that depression 
not only accelerates the rate of cognitive decline and affects the quality 
of life but also increases mortality and suicide rates in AD patients 
(44). 

[CHUNK 21396]
Seriously, patients with Alzheimer’s disease whose depressive 
symptoms are the first to occur are prone to misdiagnosis.


[CHUNK 21397]
In another systematic review study, which pooled 57 studies with 
a total of 20,892 MCI patients, the prevalence of depression was 32% 
(45). 

[CHUNK 21398]
Consequently, the relationship between depression and cognitive 
impairment is close and complex, involving the interaction of 
biological and psychosocial factors. 

[CHUNK 21399]
Current research suggests that AD 
and depression share some common pathological features, such as 
neuroinflammation, 
reduced 
synapse 
numbers, 
increased 
glucocorticoid levels, decreased BDNF levels, and decreased levels of 
monoamine neurotransmitters (46). 

[CHUNK 21400]
In a study of 69 cases of mild

cognitive impairment with 18F-FDG PET/CT patients who progressed 
to dementia showed hypometabolism in the parietal, temporal, and 
precuneus lobes (47, 48). 

[CHUNK 21402]
Moreover, patients with depression have 
hypometabolism in the frontal lobe and anterior cingulate gyrus. 

[CHUNK 21403]
On 
the contrary, patients who developed dementia without depression 
had increased metabolism in the frontal, parietal, and precuneus 
lobes. 

[CHUNK 21404]
Hence, the metabolic patterns of depression and dementia 
overlap and differ from each other.

It has been proposed that the key to the treatment of AD lies in 
screening patients who may convert to AD during the MCI phase (49) 
and intervening early so as to delay the progression of the disease and 
even block its progression to AD (50). 

[CHUNK 21448]
Current research suggests that 
Aβ deposition can be used as one of the detection indicators for the 
progression from MCI to AD. 

[CHUNK 21449]
In a study of 184 subjects with 
18F-AV45, it was found that about 76% of AD patients exhibited 
positive amyloid plaques, and for patients with MCI, about 38% of 
MCI patients showed 18F-AV45 retention in the brain, while 14% of 
the normal controls also showed Aβ deposition (51). 

[CHUNK 21450]
In addition, there 
is a significant correlation between cortical Aβ deposition and age, as 
well as the ApoE4 gene. 

[CHUNK 21451]
Notably, Aβ imaging saturates at an early stage 
of the disease, making Aβ poorly correlated with disease severity and 
unable to track progression (52).


[CHUNK 21452]
Luckily, glucose metabolism was imaging compensates for the 
deficiencies. 

[CHUNK 21453]
Specifically, in patients with mild AD, it was found that 
decreased metabolism in the unilateral temporal, parietal, or 
temporoparietal lobes, with the left side being more affected than the 
right side, and the proportion of temporal lobe involvement was 
slightly higher than that of the parietal lobe, but the frontal lobe was 
not affected. 

[CHUNK 21454]
As the disease progresses, the frontal cortex is involved 
in the middle and late stages, and typical imaging appears, bilateral 
frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe metabolism is significantly 
reduced in a symmetrical manner (53). 

[CHUNK 21455]
Not only that, the degree and 
range of metabolic reduction are positively correlated with the severity 
of clinical manifestations, but the metabolism of the striatum, 
thalamus, main sensory motor cortex, visual cortex, and cerebellum 
is relatively preserved. 

[CHUNK 21456]
This pattern is consistent with the study by 
Caroli et  al. 

[CHUNK 21457]
(39). 

[CHUNK 21458]
In summary, the frontal lobe can be  used to 
distinguish early and mid to late stages of AD. 

[CHUNK 21459]
Some studies suggest 
that AD is more prone to decreased metabolism in the posterior 
cingulate gyrus than FTD, while FTD is more prone to accumulate 
regions such as the basal ganglia than AD (50, 54). 

[CHUNK 21460]
These findings are 
helpful in the diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 21461]
Hence, if the FDG-PET and Aβ-PET are 
combined, it can contribute to improving the accuracy of AD and 
reducing misdiagnosis.


[CHUNK 21462]
The CNS inflammatory response is mainly mediated by 
microglia and astrocytes. 

[CHUNK 21463]
So the hyperactivation of microglia 
continuously releases inflammatory factors that promote 
neuroinflammation (55), and the activated microglia that mediate 
the neuroinflammation are associated with Aβ、Tau protein (56). 


[CHUNK 21464]
Furthermore, during the onset of major depressive disorder, there is 
also a correlation between neuroinflammation in the brain and the 
activation of microglia (57). 

[CHUNK 21465]
At present, the most common target for 
PET imaging of neuroinflammation is the 18KDa transporter 
protein (TSPO). 

[CHUNK 21466]
A study used TSPO-PET to study AD and showed 
that the medial temporal lobe, temporoparietal lobe, and cingulate 
cortex are the main brain areas where radioactive uptake is 
distributed (58). 

[CHUNK 21467]
Another study performed PET scans on MDD 
patients and found increased TSPO VT in the PFC, ACC, and 
insular lobe, and the larger the TSPO VT in the ACC, the higher the 
severity of depression (57). 

[CHUNK 21468]
This finding demonstrates that the 
neuroinflammatory process is related to microglia activation, which 
provides a supportive environment for developing new treatment 
methods by reducing microglia activation. 

[CHUNK 21469]
The combination of 
TSPO-PET and the TRP/KYN pathway, which is an important 
pathway for neuroinflammation, may provide a reference for further 
elucidating the pathogenesis of depression and AD.

Limitations and future directions
However, our research has some limitations. 

[CHUNK 21485]
First of all, the 
patient did not undergo genetic testing and cerebrospinal fluid testing 
in this case for personal reasons and was unable to analyze the 
genotype of the EOAD. 

[CHUNK 21486]
We are trying to further communicate with 
patients with a view to achieving genetic testing at a future follow-up. 


[CHUNK 21487]
Secondly, due to the limitations of our unit, tau protein PET and 
TSPO-PET could not be  performed to demonstrate the imaging 
features of Alzheimer’s disease in a multi-dimensional way.

the case is rather homogeneous, and it is hoped that in the future, 
prospective trials on depression with cognitive impairment can 
be carried out, combining the TRP-KYN pathway with multimodal 
imaging to find new biological markers to facilitate early diagnosis and 
detect new therapeutic targets.

Conclusion
In general, we report a case of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease with 
depression as the first symptom, which was followed for up to 9 years. 


[CHUNK 21491]
Through a literature review, the potential pathogenesis of depression 
and Alzheimer’s disease was analyzed in terms of molecular imaging, 
functional imaging, inflammation, and metabolism. 

[CHUNK 21492]
It is hoped to 
draw clinicians’ attention to patients with atypical and early-onset AD, 
so as to better identify and intervene early in AD, as well as to discover 
the potential new targets for pharmacological treatment of both 
diseases, which is of great significance for the treatment of depression 
and AD in the future.

Dentistry is an effective healthcare ﬁeld that can impact Alzheimer’s disease through
prevention and education. 

[CHUNK 21772]
Every day dental providers use an arsenal of assessment
protocols directly coinciding with modiﬁable Alzheimer’s risk factors. 

[CHUNK 21773]
An innovative way
to help in the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease is to utilize oral health professionals who
reach the public in ways other health care providers may not. 

[CHUNK 21774]
Bidirectional care integration
is needed to stiﬂe many systemic diseases and Alzheimer’s disease is no different.


[CHUNK 21775]
Ultimately with collaborative care the patient reaps the beneﬁts. 

[CHUNK 21776]
Alzheimer’s is associated
with many etiologies and pathophysiological processes. 

[CHUNK 21777]
These include cardiovascular
health, smoking, sleep, inﬂammatory pathogens, and diabetes. 

[CHUNK 21778]
In the United States,
dental providers assess each of these factors daily and can be instrumental in educating
patients on the inﬂuence of these factors for dementia prevention. 

[CHUNK 21779]
Globally, by 2025, the
number of people with Alzheimer’s disease is expected to rise by at least 14%. 

[CHUNK 21780]
Such
increases will strain local and national health care systems, but for the US if Medicare
were expanded to include dental services, many older adults could be spared needless
suffering. 

[CHUNK 21781]
The goal of this perspective article is to highlight existing practices being used
in the ﬁeld of dentistry that can easily be adapted to educate patients in preventive care
and treat risk factors. 

[CHUNK 21782]
It is the duty of healthcare professionals to explore all opportunities
to stem the advance of this disease and by integrating oral and systemic health into
transdisciplinary science, health care and policy may do just that.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive mental deterioration that occurs in middle or old age
due to the brain’s degeneration [1]. 

[CHUNK 21784]
Every 65 s, someone in the United States is diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, and it currently aﬀects over 5.8 million
people in the United States. 

[CHUNK 21785]
The Alzheimer’s Association projects by 2050 nearly 15 million people
in the United States will receive an Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 21786]
The same report shows that a full half of
primary care physicians feel unprepared to meet the demand of such a drastic increase [2]. 

[CHUNK 21787]
In 2014,
Rush University Medical Center analyzed death records nationally and found that most people who
die from Alzheimer’s have a recorded cause of death listed as respiratory or cardiac disease. 

[CHUNK 21788]
When
taking these numbers into account, AD would be elevated to the third leading cause of death in the
United States [3].


[CHUNK 21789]
Rice
Alzheimer’s and Oral Systemic Health
Hundreds of billions of dollars in research and drug
exploration have yielded a 99.6% drug failure rate [4].


[CHUNK 21790]
While various drug developers are taking diﬀerent approaches
considering such near complete failure, many scientists and
physicians are targeting prevention as the best strategy to reduce
Alzheimer’s cases [5–10]. 

[CHUNK 21791]
In 2017, The Lancet Commission
presented a report that stated more than one-third of global
dementia cases may be preventable through addressing lifestyle
factors that impact a person’s risk [11]. 

[CHUNK 21792]
The World Health
Organization (WHO) agreed with this assessment and strongly
recommended physical activity, quitting smoking, managing
hypertension, and diabetes to reduce the risk of cognitive
decline [12]. 

[CHUNK 21793]
Disturbed sleeping patterns and periodontal disease
have also been related to AD and accelerated cognitive decline
rates [13–19].


[CHUNK 21794]
The brain changes from Alzheimer’s disease start at least a
decade before symptoms show [20, 21], and as stated above,
prevention is the best current defense against this disease.


[CHUNK 21795]
Prevention strategies should begin years before the typical
onset presents, which is where dental providers can make the
most signiﬁcant contribution. 

[CHUNK 21796]
Every day, dental professionals
are performing vital tests, giving education on preventative
measures, and prescribing medications in the line of treating
and preventing dental health concerns that may also serve
to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. 

[CHUNK 21797]
If dental professionals can
use these routine tests to educate their patients and oﬀer
counseling on risk and preventative measures, more ways may
be found to reduce the human suﬀering caused by AD. 

[CHUNK 21798]
Even
simply good oral health can have a positive eﬀect on brain
health [22]. 

[CHUNK 21799]
This perspective focuses on the work that dental
professionals regularly administer in the areas of cardiovascular
health, smoking, sleep, inﬂammatory pathogens, and diabetes
that can also serve in the prevention of Alzheimer’s, with a special
note on the beneﬁt of Medicare spending in the dental ﬁeld and
Alzheimer’s prevention.


[CHUNK 21800]
HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Cardiovascular Health
Many factors related to cardiovascular health increase the risks
of Alzheimer’s [23, 24]. 

[CHUNK 21801]
Midlife obesity, hypertension, and high
cholesterol are all associated with an increased risk of dementia
[25–27]. 

[CHUNK 21802]
A study that followed Americans from 1987 to 2017
revealed that individuals with hypertension in midlife had a
signiﬁcant risk factor for cognitive decline [28]. 

[CHUNK 21803]
In a 2014 study,
Dr. 

[CHUNK 21804]
Gottesman et al. 

[CHUNK 21805]
found hypertension was associated with 39%
greater odds of dementia [29]. 

[CHUNK 21806]
Another study of over 500 people
born the same week in 1946 measured blood pressure, cognitive
assessments, and PET imaging at ages 36, 43, 53, 60–64, and 69
years. 

[CHUNK 21807]
Results showed that elevated blood pressure in middle age
resulted in drastic increases in dementia later in life, smaller brain
volume, and increased blood vessel damage [30].


[CHUNK 21808]
Discussion
Taking blood pressure is considered standard of care in dentistry.


[CHUNK 21809]
On every patient at every visit blood pressure is taken and
recorded, which enables clinicians to see subtle increases that
may indicate systemic issues. 

[CHUNK 21810]
Dental providers see patients as
often as four times more per year than their general practitioners.


[CHUNK 21811]
Panoramic radiographs are taken during regular assessments
by most dental practices at initial visits, and every 3–5 years
following. 

[CHUNK 21812]
The radiographs allow practitioners to see cysts,
tumors, wisdom teeth, the temporomandibular joint, and bone
abnormalities, including bone loss from periodontal disease.


[CHUNK 21813]
The ﬁlm can also detect any calciﬁcations in the soft tissue
area. 

[CHUNK 21814]
Atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid artery occur at
the bifurcation of the common carotid. 

[CHUNK 21815]
When these lesions
are calciﬁed, they may present on panoramic radiographs as
nodular calciﬁcations or vertical radiopacities [31]. 

[CHUNK 21816]
Often, these
issues remain undetected, as they rarely produce symptoms.


[CHUNK 21817]
Ultimately, the interruption of blood ﬂow to the brain causes
a loss of neurological function and may lead to an ischemic
or hemorrhagic stroke. 

[CHUNK 21818]
Stroke is a strong, independent, and
potentially modiﬁable risk factor for all-cause dementia [32].


[CHUNK 21819]
People who have had a stroke have nearly double the risk
of developing Alzheimer’s disease [33]. 

[CHUNK 21820]
Clinicians should be
careful to evaluate panoramic radiographs in patients who have
a history of cardiovascular disease, and other risk factors such
as smoking, hypercholesteremia, being overweight or having
diabetes. 

[CHUNK 21821]
Calciﬁcations are also associated with oral infections
and increased mortality and clinicians should carefully assess
panoramic radiographs to intercept calciﬁed atherosclerotic
lesions of the carotid artery [34]. 

[CHUNK 21822]
By remaining vigilant while
reviewing radiographs, dental professionals can help identify
potential risk factors that may be early indicators of Alzheimer’s.


[CHUNK 21823]
Smoking
Smoking is linked to vascular problems, which is a contributor
to Alzheimer’s. 

[CHUNK 21824]
This may be by way of strokes or smaller brain
bleeds, but toxins in cigarette smoke increase oxidative stress
and inﬂammation, which have been linked to Alzheimer’s. 

[CHUNK 21825]
A
2017 study found that a smoking habit increases the chance of
dementia later in life [29]. 

[CHUNK 21826]
Studies have found that smokers have
reduced brain size, speciﬁcally in the cortex, which is responsible
for many mental tasks including visual processing and complex
abstract thinking [35]. 

[CHUNK 21827]
Smoking is a leading cause of preventable
death [36], so many smokers may actually die before they reach
the age when dementia develops. 

[CHUNK 21828]
Therefore, it is diﬃcult for data
to be conclusive as to how severely smoking is related to AD,
but we know there is a strong correlation [37]. 

[CHUNK 21829]
Fortunately, by
quitting smoking, damage can at least be partially reversed [36].


[CHUNK 21830]
Discussion
Smoking cessation programs within the dental practice are
already being done, lending itself to individualized support.


[CHUNK 21831]
Dental practitioners have the availability to follow the 5 A’s
smoking cessation plan (ask, advise, assess, assist and arrange)
developed by the US Public Health Service to enhance motivation
for smokers to change their behavior [38]. 

[CHUNK 21832]
Whether clinicians
refer services, write a prescription, or perhaps even assess current
smoking status by measuring exhaled carbon monoxide levels,
they have the potential to change the lives of smoking patients.


[CHUNK 21833]

Rice
Alzheimer’s and Oral Systemic Health
help to illustrate to patients the dangers of smoking concerning
risk of AD.


[CHUNK 21835]
Sleep
Sleep is critical to overall wellness [39, 40]. 

[CHUNK 21836]
It helps to refresh the
brain, clean out waste products [41], and replenishes nutrients.


[CHUNK 21837]
Impaired sleep eﬀects the glymphatic system, the system that
clears the brains waste products, and new research suggest that
there may be a causal relationship between inadequate sleep and
dementias [42]. 

[CHUNK 21838]
Sleep cleans the hippocampus which facilitates
consolidation of memories, which is a crucial step in being able
to take in and process new information [43]. 

[CHUNK 21839]
Getting proper
amounts of sleep can help with most systemic ailments, from
lowering blood pressure, reducing depression, obesity, regulating
blood sugar, and strengthening the immune system. 

[CHUNK 21840]
Proper sleep
has been shown to increase amyloid clearance from the brain,
and new research shows that people getting proper sleep make
less amyloid [44–46]. 

[CHUNK 21841]
Other studies have found that a lack of
deep sleep is associated with higher tau levels, which forms toxic
tangles inside brain cells and may be linked to Alzheimer’s [47].


[CHUNK 21842]
Sleep apnea, a condition that happens when the airway
becomes blocked or collapses during the night, has been
associated with numerous contributory factors for AD [48, 49].


[CHUNK 21843]
According to the American Sleep Apnea Association, about 22
million Americans have sleep apnea [50]. 

[CHUNK 21844]
A 2013 study found
that older adults who experience fragmented sleep, such as that
caused by sleep apnea, are more prone to develop Alzheimer’s
disease [13].


[CHUNK 21845]
Discussion
Dentistry has become a force to help patients with sleep apnea
Dental professional’s contribution to patient care in this area
should include assisting in diagnosing and to referring to other
healthcare specialists, and to determining when dental therapies
are of value, e.g., and even treating mild to moderate apnea with
mandibular advancement devices [51, 52]. 

[CHUNK 21846]
The collaboration
between dentists and sleep physicians is growing stronger by
the day. 

[CHUNK 21847]
Being able to execute simple questionnaires like the
STOP Bang and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale can help identify
potential risk factors. 

[CHUNK 21848]
Additionally, indicators of sleep disordered
breathing, such as a scalloped tongue, large tonsils, a red beaten
uvula, or grinding patterns [53], can be noted with a simple
cursory look during an oral cancer exam. 

[CHUNK 21849]
Two of the quickest
and most simple assessments are the Malampatti score and tonsil
grading that are incredible evaluators and teaching tools for the
patient. 

[CHUNK 21850]
Dental professionals are educators and pivotal in the
discussion of risks, referrals, and treatment options of disordered
sleep, which may help to lower patient’s risk of developing
Alzheimer’s disease [54, 55].


[CHUNK 21851]
Inﬂammatory Pathogens
Compelling active research regarding microbes, the immune
system
and
the
oral
cavity
and
their
interaction
with
inﬂammation keeps periodontal disease at the forefront of
systemic discussions [56]. 

[CHUNK 21852]
Many studies have shown that older
people with periodontal disease may have an increased risk of
Alzheimer’s [57–59]. 

[CHUNK 21853]
Inﬂammation causes neural damage from
the cascade of events of the central nervous system starting
with pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as C-reactive proteins,
tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 [60].


[CHUNK 21854]
Periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis,
Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, and even HSV1
(cold sores) may all be implicated in Alzheimer’s [61–64].


[CHUNK 21855]
Dr. 

[CHUNK 21856]
Judith Miklossy has been studying spirochetes for 3
decades. 

[CHUNK 21857]
She was one of the ﬁrst to demonstrate spirochetes
in brain matter. 

[CHUNK 21858]
In vivo and in vitro spirochetes were able to
reproduce the clinical, pathological and biological hallmarks
of AD. 

[CHUNK 21859]
These results fulﬁlled Hill’s criteria and conﬁrmed a
causal relationship [65]. 

[CHUNK 21860]
A 2021 report revealed T. denticola as
a potential contributing factor, along with P. gingivalis, as risk
factors for AD. 

[CHUNK 21861]
The research group found that T. denticola had
the ability to enter the brain and increased the expression of
amyloid-β (the hallmark in AD), although the mechanism is
unclear [66].


[CHUNK 21862]
It has been reported that amyloid forms almost instantly
around viruses and bacteria, and that infections, including mild
ones that produce only minimal symptoms, ﬁre up the immune
system in the brain and leave a debris trail that is the hallmark
for Alzheimer’s [67, 68]. 

[CHUNK 21863]
When a virus or bacterium sneaks past
the blood-brain barrier, which becomes leaky with age, the brain’s
defense system is triggered. 

[CHUNK 21864]
To combat the intruder, the brain
makes amyloid to act as a sticky web to trap the intruder. 

[CHUNK 21865]
The
beta-amyloid is an antimicrobial peptide (basically, a protein)
that the immune system creates to physically trap germs, so
what is left is a webby plaque seen in the brains of those with
Alzheimer’s [69]. 

[CHUNK 21866]
Some Alzheimer’s researchers are convinced
that microbes are causative in Alzheimer’s [70, 71]. 

[CHUNK 21867]
P. gingivalis
is a high risk, red complex periodontal pathogen [72]. 

[CHUNK 21868]
There is
increasing evidence implicating the polymicrobial infection with
P. gingivalis as playing a part in disease pathogenesis, not only
from the low-grade inﬂammation but the actual translocation
into the brain vasculature [64]. 

[CHUNK 21869]
A link between Alzheimer’s and
P. gingivalis in the brain is consistent with this emerging model
for microbes in the disease’s etiology [58, 73–75].


[CHUNK 21870]
Discussion
There is mounting evidence of periodontal disease impacting
altering, systemic health negatively. 

[CHUNK 21871]
There are independent
associations between periodontal disease and a host of systemic
diseases including but not limited to: diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases, certain cancers, and cognitive diseases [76, 77]. 

[CHUNK 21872]
The
activities in health and disease within the gut, the brain and the
oral cavity seem to have overlapping consequences. 

[CHUNK 21873]
For example,
individuals with chronic local inﬂammation due to periodontal
disease have corresponding changes within the gut, to include
a link to inﬂammatory bowel disease [78]. 

[CHUNK 21874]
A growing body of
clinical and experimental evidence suggests that gut microbiota
may contribute to and inﬂuence brain disorders [79].


[CHUNK 21875]
Treating patient’s periodontal disease and preventing future
events has long been a goal of dental professionals. 

[CHUNK 21876]
The strong
evidence that reducing oral inﬂammation, created by infections
of the periodontia, contributes to a reduction in systemic
inﬂammation, reinforces the concept that dental providers have
a responsibility to help in treating a patient’s total health, which

Alzheimer’s and Oral Systemic Health
in turn may reduce the possibility of many systemic diseases
including Alzheimer’s. 

[CHUNK 21878]
We are the only licensed professionals
with this capability, so it is essential to educate ourselves and
our patients about Alzheimer’s related risks and their periodontal
health. 

[CHUNK 21879]
Whether they are a causal agent, a contributory agent, or
an exacerbator matters not, dentistry helps communities lower
their risk. 

[CHUNK 21880]
Our tools, from chairside pathogen testing to the use
of ozone and lasers, not to be out done by education skills and
behavior change strategies, can be put to use in ways to mitigate
yet another disease.


[CHUNK 21881]
Diabetes
Nearly 36% of all U.S. 

[CHUNK 21882]
adults and 50% of those 60 years or older
are estimated to have metabolic syndrome, a combination of
health conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, insulin
resistance, type 2 diabetes, or a poor lipid proﬁle [80]. 

[CHUNK 21883]
The
correlation between diabetes and risk for Alzheimer’s has been
the focus of numerous studies [81, 82]. 

[CHUNK 21884]
Additionally, there is a
new type of diabetes being studied, type 3, which is also strongly
correlated with Alzheimer’s [83]. 

[CHUNK 21885]
People with type 2 diabetes
may be twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s, and those with
prediabetes or metabolic syndrome may have an increased risk
for having predementia or mild cognitive impairment [84]. 

[CHUNK 21886]
Those
with high blood sugar, whether technically diabetic or not, have
a faster cognitive decline rate than those with normal blood
sugar [85].


[CHUNK 21887]
Discussion
Oral
health
professionals
have
long
been
aware
of
the
complications of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes. 

[CHUNK 21888]
Many
oral health professionals scrutinize health histories, question
patients, and check their blood glucose levels, yet there is
a need to increase the monitoring of diabetes during dental
visits. 

[CHUNK 21889]
In 2018, the American Dental Association added CDT
code D0411 for chairside HbA1c, and in 2019 code D0412
to check blood glucose levels. 

[CHUNK 21890]
This was not put in place for
the expectation to diagnose diabetes, but to help monitor
patients during dental procedures. 

[CHUNK 21891]
Chairside screening and
referral may improve prediabetes and diabetes diagnosis. 

[CHUNK 21892]
Point
of care testing, speciﬁcally in dental practices, can play a
vital role in the early detection of type 2 diabetes [86].


[CHUNK 21893]
Many individuals may not seek diabetic testing due to fear.


[CHUNK 21894]
Dental practitioners often have strong, trusting relationships
with patients that may help them feel more comfortable
discussing health concerns, like diabetes and Alzheimer’s. 

[CHUNK 21895]
These
are incredible opportunities for dental professionals to help in
early detection.


[CHUNK 21896]
Special Note on Medicare
Having access to dental care is diﬃcult for many US populations
especially the elderly and not having access is associated with
cognitive decline [87]. 

[CHUNK 21897]
It would be kinder and ﬁscally more
responsible to extend Medicare beneﬁts to dentistry if it lowers
the cases of a disease projected to aﬀect so many people in
such a near future. 

[CHUNK 21898]
In 2020, Alzheimer’s and other dementias
cost the nation ∼$305 and $206 billion in Medicare and
Medicaid payments [2]. 

[CHUNK 21899]
If dental care were added to Medicare,
it may help to reduce the ﬂood of cases. 

[CHUNK 21900]
Unless a treatment
to slow, stop or prevent this disease is developed, in 2050,
Alzheimer’s cost is projected to exceed $1.1 trillion. 

[CHUNK 21901]
This
dramatic rise includes more than 4-fold increases in government
spending under Medicare and Medicaid, and in out-of-pocket
spending [2].


[CHUNK 21902]
Medicare
beneﬁciaries
with
Alzheimer’s
regularly
have
other chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes,
and kidney disease, and require more skilled nursing, home
health, and hospital stays per year than other older people
[2]. 

[CHUNK 21903]
Not only are there regulations as to whether dental
professionals can even do services in a care facility depending
on state governing bodies, but there are minimal state
and federal guidelines regarding dental care. 

[CHUNK 21904]
The inclusion
of dental services in Medicare may help to combat the
ravages of Alzheimer’s disease and curtail the rapid rise in
diagnosis rates.


[CHUNK 21905]
CONCLUSION
Successful healthcare is not just the proper management of
disease, but it includes strong prevention strategies. 

[CHUNK 21906]
Something
must be done to spread knowledge on preventive measures
to help slow down the rate of Alzheimer’s disease. 

[CHUNK 21907]
The goal
of this perspective piece is to provide examples for the need
to bring dentistry into the fold of interdisciplinary approaches
in healthcare. 

[CHUNK 21908]
The utilization of all healthcare providers is
essential along with universal education, partnerships, and
healthcare coverage. 

[CHUNK 21909]
Many of our communities are left behind
due to access and cost and many professionals are not
willing to serve those regions. 

[CHUNK 21910]
Dental professionals focus on
disease prevention, health promotion and often form long-
term relationships with their patients. 

[CHUNK 21911]
The nature of these
relationships can help dental professionals notice subtle changes
that may be indicators of a future Alzheimer’s diagnosis, and
preventative care and education can then be advised. 

[CHUNK 21912]
New roles
are emerging to help address speciﬁc treatment needs and access
to dental care, but much more must be done. 

[CHUNK 21913]
Many dental
hygienists are open to not only expanding services into the
underserved communities but working within other healthcare
areas such as hospitals and physicians’ oﬃces. 

[CHUNK 21914]
Including
dental care coverage to Medicare would be advantageous
but making needed changes will not be easy. 

[CHUNK 21915]
Innovative
collaborative eﬀorts must be made, and dental professionals
are uniquely situated to help roll back the tide of this
horrible disease.

Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease
Agueda A. Rostagno
Department of Pathology, Grossman School of Medicine, New York University, New York, NY 10016, USA;
agueda.rostagno@nyulangone.org
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60% to
80% of all cases. 

[CHUNK 22322]
It is estimated that this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder currently
affects 50 million patients worldwide and indirectly impacts the lives of tens of millions
who deal with many years of cognitive decline in their loved ones [1]. 

[CHUNK 22323]
A small percentage
of all AD cases are linked to dominant genetic mutations in three genes codifying for
APP (amyloid precursor protein), PSEN1 (presenilin 1), and PSEN2 (presenilin 2) and are
typically associated with early-onset forms of the disease in which clinical symptoms appear
before the age of 65 [2,3]. 

[CHUNK 22324]
The majority of the patients exhibit late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
(LOAD), which appears later in life and is sporadic in nature. 

[CHUNK 22325]
Although in these cases the
disease is not hereditary and shows no single genetic cause, current evidence supports the
existence of a number of genetic risk factors, among which the presence of the E4 allele in
the ApoE (apolipoprotein E) gene—occurring in about 16% of the population—is the most
signiﬁcant [4]. 

[CHUNK 22326]
Lifestyle behaviors such as poor diet and reduced physical activity, as well
as environmental and metabolic risk factors including diabetes, cerebrovascular disease,
head injury, and stress, are typically linked with an increased risk for the disease [3,5,6].


[CHUNK 22327]
The deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma and the cerebral vascula-
ture, together with the presence of intraneuronal neuroﬁbrillary tangles and the gradual
loss of synapses, are central neuropathological hallmarks of AD, although, to this day, it
remains unclear what primarily triggers and drives the progression of the disease [3,7].


[CHUNK 22328]
In spite of the more than 100 years that have passed since the discovery of the disease,
the complex molecular mechanisms leading to the pathophysiology of AD have still not
been fully elucidated. 

[CHUNK 22329]
Among the different multifactorial pathways affected by the disease,
vascular abnormalities, mitochondrial detrimental changes, oxidative stress, reduced brain
glucose utilization, and neuroinﬂammation are currently being considered as important
players in the initiation and/or progression of the disease.


[CHUNK 22330]
This Special Issue of International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS) contains four
original research articles and six reviews authored by a panel of experts that highlight
the recent advances in the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms contributing
to the pathogenesis of multifactorial AD. 

[CHUNK 22331]
The research articles cover a wide range of
topics, from the inﬂuence exerted by Western diets and apoE genotypes, the analysis of
Aβ-mediated changes in synaptic dysfunction, and the upregulation of the COVID-19
receptor in the brain of AD patients, to the development of new animal models. 

[CHUNK 22332]
Mattar et al.


[CHUNK 22333]
explored the contribution of Western-style dietary patterns to the genetic risk imposed by
the ApoE4 allele [8]. 

[CHUNK 22334]
Western diets, characterized by a prolonged intake of saturated fats
and sugars, strongly increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which affects
AD susceptibility [9]. 

[CHUNK 22335]
In Mattar’s current study, homozygous male and female ApoE4
knock-in mice subjected to dietary formulations with elevated levels of saturated fats and
sucrose showed metabolic alterations and behavioral impairments. 

[CHUNK 22336]
The abnormalities were
aggravated in male animals, which also exhibited liver dysfunction and high levels of
inﬂammatory cytokines in the brain. 

[CHUNK 22337]
Notably, female ApoE4 mice exposed to the same
Western-style diet showed impairments in spatial learning and memory, but without
liver dysfunction or increased brain inﬂammatory markers.

multiple direct and indirect pathways through which genetic and diet-related factors
interact, highlighting striking sex differences in markers of chronic neuroinﬂammation,
and providing a note of caution in the need to consider gender as a crucial variable for the
interpretation of research data.


[CHUNK 22346]
Back M. et al. 

[CHUNK 22347]
focused on the neocortex, a brain region that is affected very early in AD,
and—in line with patients’ ﬁndings—in the 5xFAD AD mouse that shows spine and neuron
loss in the neocortex earlier than in the hippocampus [10]. 

[CHUNK 22348]
The authors investigated whether
the speciﬁc expression and/or regulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
subunits contributed to the early neuronal Aβ-toxicity in the neocortex by assessing in vitro
NMDAR-mediated currents in neocortical neurons with virus-mediated Aβ-overexpression,
as well as in vivo in neocortical neurons of 5xFAD mice. 

[CHUNK 22349]
The contribution of NMDAR
subunits to Aβ-toxicity for neocortical neurons was evaluated using conditional GluN1,
GluN2B, and 5xFADxGluN1/GluN2B knockout mice. 

[CHUNK 22350]
Overall, the research provides
novel insights into the mechanisms of Aβ-mediated changes in the synaptic function of
neocortical neurons and their dependence on NMDA receptors, which are known to play
important roles in learning and memory and are critical for spatial memory [11].


[CHUNK 22351]
The studies by Ding Q. et al. 

[CHUNK 22352]
linked AD with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. 

[CHUNK 22353]
Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells, is
frequently associated with neurological manifestations [12,13]. 

[CHUNK 22354]
The present study showed
the upregulated protein expression of ACE2 in the brain of AD patients and demonstrated a
moderate positive correlation between these increased levels and the presence of oxidative
stress, as indicated by the elevated presence of carbonylated proteins and the enhanced
thiol oxidation state of peroxiredoxin 6 [14]. 

[CHUNK 22355]
Overall, the study highlights the relationships
between AD and the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, underscoring the importance of carefully
monitoring patients with both Alzheimer’s disease and COVID-19 to identify higher viral
loads and long-term adverse neurological consequences in the brain.


[CHUNK 22356]
Zampar and Wirths characterized a novel AD mouse model that was generated to
evaluate the relationship between the two most prominent neuropathological hallmarks of
the disease, the extracellular Aβ deposition and the intracellular accumulation of hyper-
phosphorylated tau in neuroﬁbrillary tangles, in the absence of confounding human APP
overexpression. 

[CHUNK 22357]
The authors focused on the N-terminally truncated Aβ4–42 peptides, one
of the most abundant Aβ proteoforms in the amyloid deposits, with the aim of understand-
ing whether the presence of these peptides affected the onset or extent of tau pathology.


[CHUNK 22358]
To achieve these goals, the authors crossed the homozygous Tg4–42 mouse model of AD,
exclusively expressing Aβ4–42 peptides, with the PS19 (P301S) tau transgenic model [15].


[CHUNK 22359]
Although no signiﬁcant difference in the tau pathology was observed in the resulting line
in comparison with the PS19, a behavioral assessment showed that the double-transgenic
line presented a partial worsening of motor performance and spatial memory deﬁcits in the
aged group. 

[CHUNK 22360]
Although an increased loss of distal CA1 pyramidal neurons was detected in
young mice, no signiﬁcant alterations in hippocampal tau phosphorylation were observed
in immunohistochemical analyses.


[CHUNK 22361]
The review articles cover several of the underlying mechanisms participating in the
Alzheimer’s pathogenesis, including selective autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction,
the contribution exerted by the activation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome, and the role played
by insulin and insulin resistance. 

[CHUNK 22362]
Topics addressed by these review articles also summa-
rized imaging techniques employed in the early diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of
AD, as well as the use of metal-containing compounds for positron emission tomography
(PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single-photon emission computed tomogra-
phy (SPECT). 

[CHUNK 22363]
Sedzikowska et al. 

[CHUNK 22364]
reviewed the role played by insulin in the CNS, both in
healthy individuals and those affected with pathologies associated with insulin resistance
and AD. 

[CHUNK 22365]
The emphasis of the article was centered in two signal transduction pathways:
the PBK/AKT pathway, responsible for the metabolic effects of insulin, and the MAPK
pathway, which inﬂuences cell growth, cell survival and gene expression [16].

authors highlighted the role exerted by brain insulin resistance in the development and
progress of AD, including the increase in oxidative stress, production of Aβ42, and Tau
protein phosphorylation, which, in turn, impair mitochondrial function, cognition, and
memory. 

[CHUNK 22371]
Litwiniuk et al. 

[CHUNK 22372]
expanded on the issue of insulin resistance in the Alzheimer’s
pathogenesis by incorporating chronic inﬂammation, increased oxidative stress, and im-
paired energy metabolism as features shared by AD, obesity, and type-2 diabetes. 

[CHUNK 22373]
Particular
emphasis was given to the activation of the inﬂammasome complex, speciﬁcally NLRP3,
as well as to the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 [17]. 

[CHUNK 22374]
Based on the
inﬂuence of neuroinﬂammatory processes exerted by NLRP3, the authors postulated that
this signaling pathway may underlie the association between adiposity, insulin resistance,
and cognitive impairment.


[CHUNK 22375]
Two of the review articles focused on diagnostic imaging methodologies. 

[CHUNK 22376]
van Oost-
veen et al. 

[CHUNK 22377]
summarized the utility, beneﬁts, and limitations of multiple imaging techniques
and associated biomarkers in the early diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of AD.


[CHUNK 22378]
The manuscript discussed the value of using radiotracers to assess hippocampal volume,
hypometabolism in temporoparietal brain regions, and Aβ and Tau accumulation, empha-
sizing their limitations regarding speciﬁcity, reliability, and sensitivity [18]. 

[CHUNK 22379]
Since current
tools require relatively high levels of protein accumulation or neurodegeneration to be
detectable, the authors emphasized the need to identify novel biomarkers that reﬂect AD
pathogenesis at the earliest stages as essential for the proper development of disease-
modifying therapies. 

[CHUNK 22380]
Krasnovskaya et al. 

[CHUNK 22381]
expanded on the use of imaging techniques,
particularly in new metal-containing radiopharmaceuticals for AD visualization aimed to
avoid the current radiotracers based on 11C and 18F that are synchrotron-dependent and
short-lived. 

[CHUNK 22382]
The authors reviewed the requirements for the development of coordination
compounds capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier, and summarized metal-containing
drugs for PET, MRI, and SPECT that are suitable for imaging in AD [19].


[CHUNK 22383]
Finally, two of the review articles focused on two different crucial mechanistic path-
ways and their contribution to AD pathogenesis. 

[CHUNK 22384]
Sharma et al. 

[CHUNK 22385]
delved into the growing
evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a common driver of cognitive im-
pairment in AD. 

[CHUNK 22386]
They presented an overview of the importance of mitochondria for the
maintenance of neuronal function and their role in the pathological mechanisms involved
in many of the hallmark features of AD, including the formation of Aβ aggregates, neuroﬁb-
rillary tangles, synaptic transmission plasticity, oxidative stress, and neuroinﬂammation.


[CHUNK 22387]
Dysregulation in mitochondrial function, motility, ﬁssion, and fusion leads to neuronal
malfunction and degeneration associated with excess free radical production and reduced
intracellular calcium buffering. 

[CHUNK 22388]
They also provide a brief summary of possible treatments
targeting mitochondrial dysfunction as potential therapeutic approaches for AD [20]. 

[CHUNK 22389]
Guan
et al. 

[CHUNK 22390]
provided mechanistic insights into the process of autophagy, a mechanism that en-
sures the timely degradation of damaged cellular components in eukaryotic cells. 

[CHUNK 22391]
In recent
years, different subtypes of autophagy have been identiﬁed; in their article, the authors
extensively discussed the underlying mechanisms governing these various subtypes, with
the long-term goal of understanding how to control the process to treat AD [21]. 

[CHUNK 22392]
Since
the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that selective autophagy is an active contributing
mechanism in AD pathology, the regulation of this autophagy subtype could constitute an
effective strategy for modulating AD pathogenesis.


[CHUNK 22393]
Overall, this Special Issue underscores the multifactorial nature of AD and the com-
plexity of the pathways affected in the disease, highlighting the need to simultaneously
target multiple risk factors and disease mechanisms at an early stage and emphasizing the
urgency of developing new diagnostic strategies for a more accurate and early diagnosis.

Abstract.


[CHUNK 22545]
Background: Aerobic exercise has shown inconsistent cognitive effects in older adults with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
dementia.


[CHUNK 22546]
Objective: To examine the immediate and longitudinal effects of 6-month cycling on cognition in older adults with AD
dementia.


[CHUNK 22547]
Methods: This randomized controlled trial randomized 96 participants (64 to cycling and 32 to stretching for six months)
and followed them for another six months. 

[CHUNK 22548]
The intervention was supervised, moderate-intensity cycling for 20–50 minutes,
3 times a week for six months. 

[CHUNK 22549]
The control was light-intensity stretching. 

[CHUNK 22550]
Cognition was assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12
months using the AD Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog). 

[CHUNK 22551]
Discrete cognitive domains were measured using the AD
Uniform Data Set battery.


[CHUNK 22552]
Results: The participants were 77.4 ± 6.8 years old with 15.6 ± 2.9 years of education, and 55% were male. 

[CHUNK 22553]
The 6-month
change in ADAS-Cog was 1.0 ± 4.6 (cycling) and 0.1 ± 4.1 (stretching), which were both signiﬁcantly less than the natural
3.2 ± 6.3-point increase observed naturally with disease progression. 

[CHUNK 22554]
The 12-month change was 2.4 ± 5.2 (cycling) and
2.2 ± 5.7 (control). 

[CHUNK 22555]
ADAS-Cog did not differ between groups at 6 (p = 0.386) and 12 months (p = 0.856). 

[CHUNK 22556]
There were no
differences in the 12-month rate of change in ADAS-Cog (0.192 versus 0.197, p = 0.967), memory (–0.012 versus –0.019,
p = 0.373), executive function (–0.020 versus –0.012, p = 0.383), attention (–0.035 versus –0.033, p = 0.908), or language
(–0.028 versus –0.026, p = 0.756).


[CHUNK 22557]
Conclusion: Exercise may reduce decline in global cognition in older adults with mild-to-moderate AD dementia. 

[CHUNK 22558]
Aerobic
exercise did not show superior cognitive effects to stretching in our pilot trial, possibly due to the lack of power.

/ The FIT-AD Trial
$1.2 trillion in 2050 [1]. 

[CHUNK 22567]
While disease-modifying
drugs for AD are still lacking, aerobic exercise has
been shown to favorably modify the accumulation,
degradation, and removal of AD hallmark amyloid-
 and hyperphosphorylated tau in animal models
[2, 3]. 

[CHUNK 22568]
Aerobic exercise also appears to impact AD
non-hallmark pathology such as neuroinﬂammation,
oxidative stress, and glucose hypometabolism [2, 3].


[CHUNK 22569]
Despite these mechanistic supports, aerobic exercise
has shown inconsistent cognitive effects in random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs) across the AD spectrum
[4–12].


[CHUNK 22570]
The inconsistent ﬁndings are attributable to meth-
odological differences such as disease stage stud-
ied (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] versus AD
dementia) and exercise modality (e.g., aerobic exer-
cise only or combined exercises, walking or cycling)
and dose variations (i.e., frequency, duration, and
intensity) [4–7, 10–13]. 

[CHUNK 22571]
Aerobic exercise has been
shown to improve executive function and memory in
individuals with MCI [8, 14]. 

[CHUNK 22572]
In older adults with
AD dementia, between-group differences in cogni-
tive changes ranged from negligible [10, 11, 13] to
moderate [4–7]. 

[CHUNK 22573]
Even when between-group differ-
ences in cognition were not demonstrated, cognition
appeared to stabilize in the intervention group, but
continued to decline in the control group [10, 11].


[CHUNK 22574]
Overall, meta-analyses of RCTs suggest that aero-
bicexercisehasmodest-to-moderatecognitiveeffects
acrosstheADspectrum[15,16].Recentevidencefur-
ther supports a potential dose-response relationship
between aerobic exercise and cognition in MCI and
AD dementia [10, 11].


[CHUNK 22575]
To address these inconsistent ﬁndings, we con-
ducted a pilot RCT to evaluate a rigorous 6-month,
supervised aerobic exercise-only intervention rel-
ative to stretching control in older adults with AD
dementia. 

[CHUNK 22576]
The intervention was individualized mod-
erate intensity cycling on recumbent stationary cycles
to ensure proper dose delivery. 

[CHUNK 22577]
We chose cycling
above other modalities (e.g., walking) because
cycling on recumbent cycles is non-weight-bearing
and easy to do for a cohort with a high prevalence
of knee and hip arthritis. 

[CHUNK 22578]
Additionally, cycling
eliminates the confounding factors of motor dys-
function and gait impairment that are both common
among people with AD, can affect gait and walking
stability, and limit aerobic exercise performance.


[CHUNK 22579]
Cycling on recumbent stationary cycles is powered
by participants’ legs instead of electricity, which
adds a safety feature because of the high prevalence
of behavioral and psychological symptoms of
dementia, preventing falls or other injuries related
to electricity-powered exercise modes such as tread-
mills or elliptical machines. 

[CHUNK 22580]
The objective of this
pilot trial was to investigate the immediate and long-
term effects of 6-month aerobic cycling on cognition
in community-dwelling older adults with clinically
deﬁned probable mild-to-moderate AD dementia.


[CHUNK 22581]
Given the pilot nature, this trial was not powered
to detect between-group differences. 

[CHUNK 22582]
Instead, it was
powered on the a priori hypothesis that cycling par-
ticipants would have a smaller within-group increase
in global cognition as measured by the AD Assess-
ment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) at six months
as compared to the natural, expected 3.2 ± 6.3-point
increase. 

[CHUNK 22583]
The secondary hypothesis was that cycling
participants would show a smaller increase in ADAS-
Cog scores over 12 months compared to stretching
participants. 

[CHUNK 22584]
These hypotheses have been published
previously [17]. 

[CHUNK 22585]
In addition, we further examined the
trajectory of changes in episodic memory, executive
function, attention, processing speed, and language
over 12 months between the two groups.


[CHUNK 22586]
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This pilot RCT used a 2-parallel group design
to randomize 96 participants to 6-month supervised
cycling or stretching on a 2:1 allocation ratio. 

[CHUNK 22587]
Par-
ticipants were followed for another six months.


[CHUNK 22588]
Randomization was stratiﬁed by age (age 66–75,
76–85, and 85 + years) using random permuted
blocks of 3 and 6. 

[CHUNK 22589]
Allocation was concealed from all
investigators and data collectors, except for statisti-
cian DV who generated the randomization sequence.


[CHUNK 22590]
The randomization sequence was concealed in
opaque envelop and locked in the interventionist’s
ofﬁce. 

[CHUNK 22591]
This trial was approved by the Univer-
sity of Minnesota Institutional Review Board (IRB:
#1306M35661). 

[CHUNK 22592]
Details of the trial protocol have
been previously published (NCT01954550) [17].


[CHUNK 22593]
Setting
In-person screening, data collections, and cycle-
ergometer tests were performed on the university
campus. 

[CHUNK 22594]
Exercises were delivered in a YMCA gym
or senior community. 

[CHUNK 22595]
After the trial commencement,
we added exercise sites in year 3. 

[CHUNK 22596]
The non-blinded
staff provided transportation for participants to attend
study activities and supervised exercise delivery.

235
Participants
Community-dwelling older adults 66 + years old
with AD dementia veriﬁed by providers and by
clinician experts per 2011 diagnostic criteria [18]
were eligible if their Mini-Mental State Examina-
tion (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
was 15–26 and 0.5–2, respectively, took AD drugs>1
month if prescribed, received provider clearance for
exercise safety, and spoke English. 

[CHUNK 22599]
Individuals were
excluded who had a resting heart rate <50 or >100
beats per minute, neurologic disorders (e.g., non-AD
dementia), psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophre-
nia), alcohol or chemical dependency, exercise
contraindications, new symptoms or diseases that had
not been evaluated by providers, abnormal ﬁndings
from the cycler-ergometer test or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). 

[CHUNK 22600]
Electrocardiograms from the cycle-
ergometer test were independently read by the study
physicians (LSC) and exercise physiologist (DS).


[CHUNK 22601]
MRI was processed and read for abnormality by the
study radiologist and his team at Mayo Clinic. 

[CHUNK 22602]
After
the trial commencement, we removed investigator
consensus diagnosis from inclusion criteria in year 2
to improve efﬁciency as few cases were disqualiﬁed.


[CHUNK 22603]
Instead, the principal investigator (FY) conﬁrmed
the accuracy of provider-veriﬁed AD dementia by
reviewing the summary of each potential participant
using data abstracted from medical records (if avail-
able) and collected during the screening (e.g., health
history, diagnoses, medications, and scores on cogni-
tive and functional instruments) and, if questionable,
consulted with the study neuropsychologist (NWN)
and geriatrician (MD).


[CHUNK 22604]
Master’s-level staff in neuroscience (project man-
ager) and exercise science (interventionist) were
trained by the PI and used a multi-pronged recruit-
ment approach and potential participants initiated
their contact with the staff (published previously)
[17]. 

[CHUNK 22605]
Recruitment began in March 2014 and ended
in March 2018. 

[CHUNK 22606]
The trial ended when the last
data collection was completed in October 2020.


[CHUNK 22607]
Based on assessment of the individual’s decision-
making capacity, participants gave informed consent
or assent with surrogate consent. 

[CHUNK 22608]
Re-consent was
conducted before each of the subsequent data collec-
tions. 

[CHUNK 22609]
Decision-capacity was assessed to determine
if self or surrogate consent was needed. 

[CHUNK 22610]
The project
manager provided a summary of a participant’s
eligibility to the team (PI, exercise physiologist,
and interventionist) to conﬁrm eligibility and then
enroll the participant. 

[CHUNK 22611]
After completing baseline data
collection, the participant was enrolled by the project
manager. 

[CHUNK 22612]
The interventionist then opened the ran-
domization envelop sequentially within each stratum
to reveal the participant’s group allocation.


[CHUNK 22613]
The target sample size was 90, which was powered
on the within-group, 6-month change in ADAS-Cog
in the intervention group, in comparison to the mean
3.2-point increase from placebo groups in AD drug
RCTs (N = 536; standard deviation [SD] = 6.25) [19].


[CHUNK 22614]
Assuming 2-sided t-test at 0.05, 16% attrition at six
months, and intention-to-treat, our target sample size
had 80% power to detect a signiﬁcant difference in
ADAS-Cog [17]. 

[CHUNK 22615]
After meeting our enrollment goal
in year 4, we increased the sample size to 96 to
allow individuals in the screening process to con-
tinue, which was approved by the Data Safety and
Monitoring Board, NIA, and IRB.


[CHUNK 22616]
Intervention
Thecyclinginterventionwasprescribedat50–75%
of heart rate reserve (HRR) or 9–15 on the 6–20
Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale for
20–50 min a session, three times a week for six
months (72 sessions). 

[CHUNK 22617]
An interventionist supervised
each session which lasted 40–60 min after adding
5 min warm-up and 5 min cool-down. 

[CHUNK 22618]
Sessions were
delivered over 27 weeks to account for 3-month data
collection, vacations, and illnesses. 

[CHUNK 22619]
HR was contin-
uously monitored with Precor HR monitor and the
proper use of RPE was continuously reinforced. 

[CHUNK 22620]
In
week 1, participants started at 50–55% of HRR or
RPE 9–11 for 20–30 min as tolerated. 

[CHUNK 22621]
In week 2,
participants maintained the same intensity as that in
week 1, but the session duration was increased by
ﬁve min to 30–40 min. 

[CHUNK 22622]
In week 3, the session dura-
tion was held the same as that in week 2, but intensity
was increased by 5% of HRR or 1-point on RPE
to 55–60% of HRR or RPE 10–12. 

[CHUNK 22623]
These alterna-
tive increases in session duration and intensity were
continued until the targets of 70–75% HRR (or RPE
12–14) and 50 min were achieved, which typically
occurred in week 10.


[CHUNK 22624]
The control exercise was stretching and range-
of-motion prescribed at the same frequency, session
duration, and program duration as cycling, but at low
intensity (<20% of HRR or < RPE 9). 

[CHUNK 22625]
It included
primarily seated movements and static stretches. 

[CHUNK 22626]
The
number of repetitions and durations for each stretch
was gradually increased to match cycling session
durations [17]. 

[CHUNK 22627]
After the trial commencement, we
increased interventionist-to-participants ratio from

deliver sessions.


[CHUNK 22630]
Main outcomes and measures
The primary outcome was global cognition as
measured by the ADAS-Cog. 

[CHUNK 22631]
Secondary outcomes
(episodic memory, executive function, attention,
processing speed, and language) were primarily
measured using the AD Centers’ Uniform Data Set
neuropsychological test battery [20]. 

[CHUNK 22632]
Alternative
forms of an instrument, if available, were used to
reduce practice effects. 

[CHUNK 22633]
Cognition was assessed prior

and 12 months.


[CHUNK 22634]
Global cognition was measured using the ADAS-
Cog, which is used widely used in AD drug RCTs
[21]. 

[CHUNK 22635]
It assesses orientation, memory, recall, lan-
guage, and praxis with a total score of 0–70 (higher
score = worse function) with 0.65–0.99 interrater reli-
ability and 0.51–1.0 test-retest reliability [21].


[CHUNK 22636]
Episodic memory was evaluated with the Wech-
sler Memory Scale–Revised Logical Memory subtest
[22] and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised
[23]. 

[CHUNK 22637]
Executive function was assessed with the Trail
Making Test (TMT) Part B [24], Exit Interview-25
(EXIT-25) [25], and Executive Clock Drawing Task
[26]. 

[CHUNK 22638]
Attention was assessed with the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale–Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Span
tests [27]. 

[CHUNK 22639]
Processing speed was measured with the
WAIS-Third Edition Digit Symbol test [22], Golden
Stroop [28], and TMT Part A [24]. 

[CHUNK 22640]
Language was
assessed with the Controlled Oral Word Association
test [29], Category Fluency test [30], and Boston
Naming Test [29].


[CHUNK 22641]
Covariates at baseline included dementia severity
as measured by the MMSE. 

[CHUNK 22642]
Premorbid intellect was
measured using the Wechsler Test of Adult Read-
ing [31]. 

[CHUNK 22643]
Behavioral and psychological symptoms
of dementia (BPSD) were measured by the Neu-
ropsychiatric Inventory-Caregiver [32]. 

[CHUNK 22644]
ADL was
measured by the Disability Assessment for Demen-
tia [33]. 

[CHUNK 22645]
Body mass index was calculated from weight
andheight.UseofADdrug(yes/no),comorbidities(#
of chronic conditions), and demographics (age, sex,
race, education, marital status, and living arrange-
ment) were collected using a questionnaire. 

[CHUNK 22646]
Exercise
adherence was objectively determined. 

[CHUNK 22647]
During each
exercise session, the interventionist documented par-
ticipants’ heart rates and RPE every 5 min on the
Session Report Form. 

[CHUNK 22648]
Heart rates, RPE, and dura-
tions in each session were used to deﬁne adherence
in three ways: 1) the percent of 72 prescribed sessions
attended, 2) the percent of attended sessions that
met both the session intensity and duration prescrip-
tion, and 3) per-protocol adherence that was deﬁned
as attending >70% sessions and >70% of attended
sessions meeting the session intensity and duration
prescription.


[CHUNK 22649]
Statistical analyses
ADAS-Cog raw scores were used. 

[CHUNK 22650]
Composite z-
scores were created for discrete cognitive domains,
following the established procedures [34, 35]: 1) the
directions of scores were reversed when lower raw
scores are equivalent to better cognition (TMT Part
A, TMT Part B, and EXIT-25), so that higher scores
signify better cognition [34]; 2) raw scores were
transformed to z-scores using the mean and SD of an
instrument at baseline in the whole sample (n = 96): z-
score = (rawscore–baselinemean)/baselineSD;and
3) z-scores of all measures were averaged to create a
domain-speciﬁc composite z-score.


[CHUNK 22651]
Descriptive statistics were summarized as means
(SD: standard deviation) for continuous variables
or frequency (percentage) for categorical vari-
ables. 

[CHUNK 22652]
Baseline differences between the groups were
tested using Wilcoxon rank sum tests (continuous
covariates) or Pearson chi-square tests (categorical
covariates). 

[CHUNK 22653]
The primary hypothesis was analyzed
using 2-sided t-test of the mean change for each
randomization group, in comparison to the 3.2-point
increaseexpectedwiththenaturaldiseasecourse.The
6- and 12-month changes in cognition were compared
between the two groups using two-sample t-tests.


[CHUNK 22654]
The longitudinal trajectory of cognitive outcomes
over 12-month (ﬁve data collection visits every three
months) was assessed using mixed-effects models
which include ﬁxed effects for treatment group, (a
function of) time, and their interaction and random
participant-speciﬁc intercepts, and residuals with
an AR(1) autoregressive correlation structure. 

[CHUNK 22655]
This
model allows one to estimate the average rates of
change in outcomes within and between groups. 

[CHUNK 22656]
All
inferential analyses were conducted following the
intention-to-treat principle [17].


[CHUNK 22657]
All analyses were conducted using R Version 3.5.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing; Vienna,
Austria) and two-sided tests with p < 0.05 indi-
cating statistical signiﬁcance. 

[CHUNK 22658]
No adjustment for

[CHUNK 22666]
Ninety-six

[CHUNK 22668]
The attrition rate for the ADAS-Cog was 17.7% at
6 months (17.2% cycling versus 18.8% stretching)
and 25% at 12 months (26.6% cycling versus 25%
stretching; Fig.

A priori hypothesis on the 6-month effect of
cycling on ADAS-Cog
Our primary hypothesis that cycling participants
will have a smaller within-group increase in ADAS-
Cog at six months (1.0 ± 4.6) than the natural,
expected 3.2 ± 6.3-point increase was supported
(p = 0.001).


[CHUNK 22676]
Secondary hypothesis on the 12-month change in
global cognition
Our secondary hypothesis that cycling participants
would show a smaller increase in the ADAS-Cog over
12 months as compared to stretching participants was
not supported. 

[CHUNK 22677]
The 12-month change in ADAS-Cog
was 2.4 ± 5.2 for cycling and 2.2 ± 5.7 for stretching.


[CHUNK 22678]
There were no signiﬁcant differences in ADAS-Cog
at 6 and 12 months between groups (Table 2).


[CHUNK 22679]
Rates of changes in cognition over 12 months
The rate of changes in ADAS-Cog over 12 months
was smaller for the cycling group than that of the
control (0.192 versus 0.200), but their differences
were not statistically signiﬁcant (Table 3). 

[CHUNK 22680]
During
the 6-month intervention period, cycling partici-
pants experienced signiﬁcant cognitive declines in
attention, processing speed, and language, but the
declines in memory and executive function were not
signiﬁcant (Table 2). 

[CHUNK 22681]
Their 12-month declines in
all cognitive domains were statistically signiﬁcant.


[CHUNK 22682]
In contrast, control participants manifested signif-
icant declines in memory, processing speed, and
language, but not in executive function and attention
over the 6-month intervention period. 

[CHUNK 22683]
Their cognition
declined over 12 months except for executive func-
tion (Table 2). 

[CHUNK 22684]
The rates of changes over 12 months in
discrete cognitive domains did not differ statistically
between groups (Table 3).


[CHUNK 22685]
Exercise adherence and adverse events
There were no differences between the groups in
the percent of attended exercise sessions, the per-
cent of attended sessions that met the intensity and
prescription, or adherence per protocol (>70% ses-

DISCUSSION
Our ﬁndings support a priori hypothesis that inter-
vention participants had a smaller 6-month increase
in ADAS-Cog than the expected decline associated
with the natural disease progression. 

[CHUNK 22700]
The 6- and 12-
month changes in ADAS-Cog did not differ between
the cycling and stretching groups. 

[CHUNK 22701]
The 12-month rates


[CHUNK 22702]
F. Yu et al. 

[CHUNK 22703]
/ The FIT-AD Trial
241
of changes in global cognition and discrete cognitive
domains did not reach statistical signiﬁcance between
groups.


[CHUNK 22704]
Our primary ﬁnding indicates that a 6-month aer-
obic exercise intervention signiﬁcantly reduced the
decline in global cognition in comparison to AD
dementia’s natural course of decline. 

[CHUNK 22705]
This ﬁnding is
consistent with the results from other RCTs which
have demonstrated that aerobic exercise improved or
stabilized global cognition over time among older
adults with MCI or dementia [36–38]. 

[CHUNK 22706]
We bench-
marked the intervention effect on ADAS-Cog decline
to the 6-month natural course of decline in AD which
has well been established in older adults with mild-to-
moderate AD dementia [19]. 

[CHUNK 22707]
In addition, ADAS-Cog
has been the most frequently used measure in drug
RCTs [19] and allows the comparison of the effect
sizes from many different interventions from aerobic
exercise to novel AD therapeutics.


[CHUNK 22708]
We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant between-group differ-
ence in global cognition at either six or 12 months.


[CHUNK 22709]
Our ﬁndings are consistent those from recent RCTs
using similar aerobic exercise doses in older adults
with MCI [36] and early AD dementia [10, 11].


[CHUNK 22710]
For example, the Danish ADEX trial showed that
16 weeks of aerobic exercise on treadmill, cycling,
or cross-trainer at 70–80% of age-predicted maxi-
mal heart rate ( = 220-age) did not produce signiﬁcant
group differences in executive function as measured
by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test in partici-
pants with mild AD dementia [11]. 

[CHUNK 22711]
A U.S. 

[CHUNK 22712]
RCT
also reported a lack of group differences in memory
and executive function from 26 weeks of moderate-
intensity aerobic exercise on in older adults with
MCI or mild AD dementia [10]. 

[CHUNK 22713]
Another trial that
evaluated a combined aerobic and strength training
exercise program in dementia in the UK, the largest
exercise trial conducted to date, reported a nega-
tive intervention effect on ADAS-Cog [12]. 

[CHUNK 22714]
However,
the lack of statistically signiﬁcant between-group
differences in cognition should not necessarily be
interpreted as though aerobic exercise was not effec-
tive. 

[CHUNK 22715]
The Danish ADEX trial, for example, did ﬁnd
a 2.5-point difference, albeit not statistically signiﬁ-
cant, between the groups in favor of the intervention
group [11]. 

[CHUNK 22716]
The UK trial included all dementia sub-
types with 36% of the sample having AD dementia
and it is unclear if the delivered aerobic-exercise
reached the recommended 150-minute moderate-
intensity weekly dose for general health [12]. 

[CHUNK 22717]
When
comparing participants who achieved high dose (high
attendance and high intensity) of the intervention ver-
sus low dose in the ADEX trial, the between-group
difference in executive function was signiﬁcant [39].


[CHUNK 22718]
A U.S. 

[CHUNK 22719]
trial further found that changes in aerobic
ﬁtness and memory were positively correlated [10].


[CHUNK 22720]
The lack of between-group differences in cogni-
tive effect in our trial was anticipated since our trial
was not powered to detect group differences. 

[CHUNK 22721]
The
lack of power may be a reason why the recent RCTs
were unable to detect signiﬁcant between-group dif-
ferences in cognitive outcomes [10, 11]. 

[CHUNK 22722]
Currently,
onlyafewexerciseRCTsinADhaveusedtheADAS-
Cog [11, 40, 41]. 

[CHUNK 22723]
In an Australian study (n = 40), four
months of aerobic exercise decreased ADAS-Cog
scores by 4.9 ± 1.1 points from baseline 22.7 ± 9.7
in comparison to an increase of 2.1 ± 1.4 points from
baseline 26.6 ± 16.6 in the control group (p = 0.001)
[41]. 

[CHUNK 22724]
In the Denmark ADEX Trial (n = 200), only
ADAS-Cog immediate and delayed recall trials were
used as secondary measures and showed neither
within- nor between-group differences [11]. 

[CHUNK 22725]
The
pooled placebo groups in drug trials showed a base-
line score of 28.4 ± 10.6 (n = 536) [19]. 

[CHUNK 22726]
In contrast,
our participants scored 19.3 ± 7.4 versus 17.8 ± 6.5
(intervention versus control) at baseline, suggest-
ing that their relatively better cognition at baseline
may have left little room for improvement above
and beyond measurement errors, contributing further
to challenges identifying between-group differences
in ADAS-Cog changes. 

[CHUNK 22727]
Lastly, our intervention par-
ticipants had more chronic conditions, BPSD, and
caregiver distress as well as worse mood than the
controls at baseline than controls (Table 1). 

[CHUNK 22728]
These
differences may have affected dose adherence, atten-
uated the beneﬁts of cycling, and limited our ability
to detect between-group differences.


[CHUNK 22729]
We have learned several important lessons for
designing future trials. 

[CHUNK 22730]
First, a non-exercise control
may be more appropriate to reduce Hawthorne and
social interaction effects such as a waitlist, usual care,
or non-exercise group. 

[CHUNK 22731]
When designing the FIT-AD
trial, we speciﬁcally matched the intervention and
control exercises on frequency and duration, which
inadvertently and substantially increased social inter-
actions in the control group during implementation.


[CHUNK 22732]
Participants perceived stretching as boring and the
interventionists socialized with stretching partic-
ipants extensively to prevent non-adherence and
dropout. 

[CHUNK 22733]
In contrast, the physical demand of cycling
limited social interaction. 

[CHUNK 22734]
At least one previous trial
showed that exercise and social interactions affected
cognition similarly in nursing home residents with
dementia [42]. 

[CHUNK 22735]
Second, strategies are needed to


[CHUNK 22736]
242
F. Yu et al. 

[CHUNK 22737]
/ The FIT-AD Trial
reduce cross-contamination from the control group.


[CHUNK 22738]
Some family members and participants had reached
out to us, expressing their strong dissatisfaction
about being in the control group. 

[CHUNK 22739]
Approximately a
third of our control participants improved their aer-
obic ﬁtness over the 6-month intervention period,
re-afﬁrming our perception that some stretching par-
ticipants participated in aerobic exercise outside of
the study. 

[CHUNK 22740]
Third, makeup sessions need to be offered
to all participants including those who achieved the
per-protocol dose. 

[CHUNK 22741]
We only offered makeup ses-
sions to participants who fell below 70% attendance.


[CHUNK 22742]
Subsequently, we implemented this strategy in our
ACT Trial [43] and improved session adherence
to >80% with a number of participants achieving
100%. 

[CHUNK 22743]
Fourth, the intervention duration should not be
restricted to calendar months. 

[CHUNK 22744]
While calendar months
made it easy to track data collections, they prohib-
ited our participants from receiving an actual 6-month
duration of exercise because extended absences from
vacations and medical clearance were frequent. 

[CHUNK 22745]
The
6-month duration is considered to be the minimal
dose necessary to induce cognitive changes [44].


[CHUNK 22746]
Greater intensity and longer duration are needed in
future trials. 

[CHUNK 22747]
For example, post-hoc analysis showed
that the average intensity achieved by our partici-
pants was about 54% of HRR, which was below the
prescription.


[CHUNK 22748]
The strengths of our RCT include a rigorous design
and implementation following clinical trial guide-
lines, interventionist-supervised exercise delivery to
allow an accurate measurement of delivered doses,
relatively high attendance, matched social interven-
tions between groups, and the use of validated
outcome measures. 

[CHUNK 22749]
In addition, examining cognitive
outcomes from the perspective of lack of decline
instead of improvement is a unique strength. 

[CHUNK 22750]
When
AD pathology reaches certain thresholds to warrant
the diagnosis of AD dementia, ongoing cognitive
decline is likely irreversible [45]. 

[CHUNK 22751]
This conclusion has
led trials to re-focus on preclinical AD and MCI when
AD pathology is less severe [46]. 

[CHUNK 22752]
Despite the known
irreversible, declining trajectory of cognition in AD
dementia, clinical trials and meta-analyses continue
to focus on cognitive improvement as a favorable
outcome [15, 16]. 

[CHUNK 22753]
Our ﬁndings better align with the
direction of future AD dementia trials by focusing
on the more realistic outcome of reducing the rate of
cognitive decline.


[CHUNK 22754]
We acknowledge several weaknesses in our study.


[CHUNK 22755]
One weakness is the lack of power to detect group
differences in outcomes. 

[CHUNK 22756]
Other weaknesses include
enrollment of participants with mild or moderate
stages of AD dementia which reduced sample homo-
geneity and may have restricted our ability to identify
signiﬁcant effects, a selection bias where mild and
moderate stages of AD dementia were unequally
represented, and a lack of a validated measure of
comorbidity. 

[CHUNK 22757]
This trial is also limited by not using
biomarkers as the primary outcome. 

[CHUNK 22758]
The ADAS-Cog
was the most widely used endpoint in AD clinical
trials, particularly in drug trials. 

[CHUNK 22759]
It is increasingly
used in exercise trials, albeit limited, which allows
the benchmarking of exercise effects to those of
novel drug therapeutics. 

[CHUNK 22760]
There are still a limited num-
ber of aerobic-exercise trials in older adults with
AD dementia using the ADAS-Cog. 

[CHUNK 22761]
In contrast,
biomarker endpoints may be more sensitive to inter-
vention effects. 

[CHUNK 22762]
Once the methodological (consistent
processing and analytical methods and cut points)
[45] and cost issues are resolved, biomarkers could
potentially serve as endpoints in future exercise trials.


[CHUNK 22763]
Conclusions and relevance
Our trial showed that aerobic exercise reduced
global cognition decline. 

[CHUNK 22764]
The lack of between-group
differences in cognition over time is likely explained
by the lack of power, a sicker intervention group than
control, and under-recognized Hawthorne and social
interaction effects. 

[CHUNK 22765]
Our ﬁndings support the clinical
relevance of promoting aerobic exercise in individ-
uals with AD dementia. 

[CHUNK 22766]
Analyses of our baseline
data showed that our participants had substantially
lower aerobic ﬁtness in comparison to age- and
gender-matched peers [47] and have an average of 3.5
comorbidities, and both issues are amenable to aer-
obic exercise. 

[CHUNK 22767]
Although we did not measure quality
of life, participants and family caregivers had con-
sistently and overwhelmingly expressed the positive
impact of exercise on their lives. 

[CHUNK 22768]
Studies in AD have
also shown that aerobic exercise improved physical
function and behavioral and psychological symptoms
of dementia [11, 39]. 

[CHUNK 22769]
In addition, aerobic exercise has
a low proﬁle of adverse events in older adults with AD
dementia as demonstrated by our trial. 

[CHUNK 22770]
Hence, regard-
less of its effect on cognition, the current collective
evidence supports the use of aerobic exercise as an
adjuvant therapy for AD.

Abstract
Dementia is one of the greatest global challenges for health and social care in the 21st century. 

[CHUNK 22873]
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common
type of dementia, is by no means an inevitable consequence of growing old. 

[CHUNK 22874]
Several lifestyle factors may increase, or reduce, an individual’s risk
of developing AD. 

[CHUNK 22875]
Much has been written over the ages about the beneﬁts of exercise and physical activity. 

[CHUNK 22876]
Among the risk factors associated
with AD is a low level of physical activity. 

[CHUNK 22877]
The relationship between physical and mental health was established several years ago. 

[CHUNK 22878]
In this review,
we discuss the role of exercise (aerobic and resistance) training as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of AD. 

[CHUNK 22879]
Older adults
who exercise are more likely to maintain cognition. 

[CHUNK 22880]
We address the main protective mechanism on brain function modulated by physical exercise
by examining both human and animal studies. 

[CHUNK 22881]
We will pay especial attention to the potential role of exercise in the modulation of amyloid b
turnover, inﬂammation, synthesis and release of neurotrophins, and improvements in cerebral blood ﬂow. 

[CHUNK 22882]
Promoting changes in lifestyle in pre-
symptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying one-third of dementias worldwide. 

[CHUNK 22883]
Multimodal interventions
that include the adoption of an active lifestyle should be recommended for older populations.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of
dementia and one of the most frequent neurodegenerative
pathologies in elderly people, constituting about 90% of the
cases of dementia in this population. 

[CHUNK 22886]
AD is characterized by
its irreversibility and progressive functional, cognitive, and
behavioral loss. 

[CHUNK 22887]
It is usually accompanied by various brain dis-
orders such as amnesia, agnosia, apraxia, and aphasia.1
Twenty-four million people in the world suffer from AD,
and it is expected that by 2050 this number will be 4 times
greater.2 These alarming numbers are explained by the fact
that the main risk factor for this disease is age,3 and by
2050 it is estimated that the population over 65 years will
be 3 times larger than it was in 2010, reaching close to 1.5
billion people.


[CHUNK 22888]
AD is a devastating disease. 

[CHUNK 22889]
The social and human cost for
patients and caregivers is overwhelming, and the economic
cost of AD is unaffordable. 

[CHUNK 22890]
For instance, in the United States
in 2017, the annual cost of care per patient over 65 with AD or
another type of dementia was USD 48,000, or 3.5 times more
than for a person without any type of dementia.4,5
AD is characterized by the loss of neuronal synapses and
pyramidal neurons accompanied by progressive cognitive neu-
rodegeneration.6 The regions associated with more complex
brain functions, such as the hippocampus and the neocortex,
are the most affected.

[CHUNK 22900]
Although there are several hypotheses to explain the origin
of AD, the 2 main neuropathological features include the extra-
cellular accumulation of senile plaques around the neurons and
the glia, and the intracellular formation of neuroﬁbrillary tangles
(NFTs). 

[CHUNK 22901]
Senile plaques are formed mainly by the accumulation
of insoluble amyloid b (Ab) protein, especially its isoform
Ab42, which is formed by the enzymatic cleavage of the trans-
membrane amyloid precursor protein (APP).7,8 NFTs are
formed from the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. 

[CHUNK 22902]
The
main function of this protein is to stabilize the microtubules so
that they connect with other elements of the neuronal cytoskele-
ton, such as neuroﬁlaments and actin.9
Another feature in AD is the inﬂammatory response at the
brain level. 

[CHUNK 22903]
In the early stages of the disease, the immune
response results in a removal of Ab, ameliorating its symp-
toms.10,11 To generate a balance between the deposition and the
clearance of Ab, microglia plays a fundamental role by engulf-
ing insoluble deposits of this peptide through the activation of
receptors that promote phagocytic action, such as cluster of dif-
ferentiation 36 (CD36), and receptors for advanced-glycosyla-
tion end products.12,13 Microglia also activates extracellular
proteases such as neprilysin, the insulin degrading enzyme,
endothelin
converting
enzyme
1,
angiotensin
converting
enzyme,
matrix
metalloprotease,
and
the
presequence
peptidase.1416 During advanced stages of the disease there is a
prolonged stimulation of the immune response caused by Ab,
which leads to a decrease in the efﬁciency of the microglia to
degrade it.17 In turn, this leads to the release of several proin-
ﬂammatory products, such as cytokines, reactive oxygen, and
nitrogen species, leading to an increase in the production of Ab
and the hyperphosphorylation of tau, generating more damage
and neuronal death.1820 This state contributes to an increase in
cognitive decline and the development of the disease.


[CHUNK 22904]
The risk factors associated with AD, apart from age, are low
educational level, diabetes, genetics, belonging to certain
minority ethnic groups (prevalence of dementia is higher in
British AfricanCaribbean people),21 diet, previous brain
injuries, sleep disorders, hypertension, hearing loss, and low
levels of physical activity.22 Physical activity (“any movement
of the body”) and exercise (“physical activity that is typiﬁed
by speciﬁc and purposeful training”) constitute 2 different con-
cepts.23 However, for the sake of clarity we refer to both these
concepts interchangeably since some of the reports we refer to
in this review use these expressions as synonyms. 

[CHUNK 22905]
Older adults
are considered physically active when they perform moderate-
intensity aerobic physical activities for a minimum of 30 min,
5 days/week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic activity for a mini-
mum of 20 min, 3 days/week.23 Also, combinations of moder-
ate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet
this recommendation. 

[CHUNK 22906]
Moderate-intensity aerobic activity
involves a moderate level of effort relative to an individual’s
aerobic ﬁtness. 

[CHUNK 22907]
On a 10-point scale, where sitting is 0 and all-
out effort is 10, moderate-intensity activity is rated as a 5 or 6
and produces noticeable increases in heart rate and breathing.


[CHUNK 22908]
Using the same scale, vigorous-intensity activity is rated as a 7
or 8 and produces large increases in heart rate and breathing.


[CHUNK 22909]
Thus, physical inactivity, a concept that has also been included
in this review, is deﬁned as not meeting any of the following 2
criteria: 30 min of moderate-intensity physical activity on at
least 5 days/week or 20 min of vigorous-intensity physical
activity on at least 3 days/week.


[CHUNK 22910]
Gender is also considered a risk factor for AD; two-thirds of
AD patients are women.5 This proportion is mainly attributed
to the greater longevity of women over men, which makes
them more susceptible to this and other age-associated dis-
eases and syndromes.24 Apart from this fact, if there is a real
relationship between sex and AD risk, it is not clear. 

[CHUNK 22911]
In the lit-
erature, epidemiological studies with controversial results can
be found.2527 Several results point to sex hormones as
responsible, at least partially, for the higher incidence of AD
in women. 

[CHUNK 22912]
The important changes in sex hormone concentra-
tions associated with a woman’s age, the role of sexual dimor-
phism in the neuronal structures development, the gene-by-sex
interactions, and the increased speciﬁc immune response of
women, have all been associated with an increased risk of
AD.26
In this review, we mainly discuss the role of physical exer-
cise as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention
of AD.

Physical exercise and physiologic brain aging
Physical inactivity contributes to about 5 million deaths in
the world each year from noncommunicable diseases.28 The
inverse relationship between a physically active life and the
risk of suffering cognitive decline is widely documented,29
and aerobic exercise training has been the most extensively
used option for the study of the effect of physical activity in
alleviating the negative impact of aging in cognitive func-
tion.29,30 The ﬁrst evidence was published in the 1970s, when
it was shown that middle-aged sports practitioners had
better response in cognitive tasks that involved a psychomotor
component when compared with sedentary aged-matched sub-
jects.31 More recently, 1 study found a signiﬁcant improve-
ment in memory among middle-aged trained individuals,
compared to sedentary subjects, when the Free and Cued
Immediate Recall test was administered to both groups.32 The
positive impact of long-term exercise training by delaying the
onset of physiologic memory loss suggests the effectiveness of
exercise as a preventive strategy against age-related memory
loss and neurodegeneration. 

[CHUNK 22915]
However, it is worth mentioning
that late-onset exercise interventions have also shown positive
results in the delay of brain aging. 

[CHUNK 22916]
For example, in a ground-
breaking paper published in 2011, the authors found that 1
year of moderate-intensity exercise (40 min duration, 3 days/
week) increased the size of the hippocampus, as well as
increasing spatial memory, in healthy older individuals.33 The
anatomic changes induced by aerobic exercise have also been
conﬁrmed by other research groups. 

[CHUNK 22917]
For instance, it has been
found that 6 months of exercise (60 min duration, 3 days/
week) is sufﬁcient to increase both the gray and white matter
in the anterior cingulate cortex, as measured by magnetic reso-
nance imaging, in older, cognitively healthy subjects.34 Longer
aerobic exercise training protocols (3 years’ duration) in
Exercise in Alzheimer’s disease
395


[CHUNK 22918]
sedentary older women have shown improvements in reaction
time, motor function, and cognitive processing speed, indicat-
ing that exercise is effective in reversing or at least slowing
the age-related declines in motor performance and in speed of
cognitive processing.35 However, some evidence shows that
aerobic exercise interventions do not always induce improve-
ments
in
cognitive
function
in
older
subjects
(6080
years).3638 These contradictory results may be explained by
the training duration, frequency, and/or intensity of the inter-
ventions.


[CHUNK 22919]
The impact of resistance exercise on cognitive function
has gained notice in the past few years. 

[CHUNK 22920]
In a recent meta-anal-
ysis, more than 24 studies were reviewed that investigated the
effects of weight lifting on different cognitive outcomes in
older individuals. 

[CHUNK 22921]
According to the results, resistance training
has positive effects on measurements related to the detection
of cognitive impairment and executive functions. 

[CHUNK 22922]
However,
resistance training has no effect on working memory meas-
urements.39 Although a high heterogeneity was observed in
all analyses, the authors concluded that resistance training
seemed to have positive effects on cognition. 

[CHUNK 22923]
However,
future research will need to determine why the effects are so
variable.


[CHUNK 22924]
From this ﬁrst part of the review, we can conclude that
exercise programs with components of both aerobic and resis-
tance training, of moderate intensity, and lasting at least 45
min per session on as many days of the week as possible, are
beneﬁcial in terms of cognitive function in older healthy
adults.40

[CHUNK 22925]
Physical exercise and multimodal interventions for the
treatment and prevention of AD
Dementia is by no means an inevitable consequence of
reaching retirement age. 

[CHUNK 22926]
There are lifestyle factors that may
decrease, or increase, an individual’s risk of developing
dementia.22 Around 35% of dementia is attributable to a com-
bination of 9 risk factors: low education level, midlife hyper-
tension, midlife obesity, hearing loss, later-life depression,
diabetes, smoking, social isolation, and, of course, low physi-
cal activity.41
A meta-analysis that included 16 studies with more than
160,000 participants found a 45% reduction in the risk of
developing AD due to the regular practice of physical activity
(hazard ratio = 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval: 0.360.84,
p = 0.006).42 In a sample of 716 older subjects followed for
3.5 years, similar results were found when assessing the risk of
suffering AD. 

[CHUNK 22927]
Those individuals with low daily physical activ-
ity levels were 53% more likely to suffer AD than those who
reported more active lives (hazard ratio = 0.477, 95% conﬁ-
dence interval: 0.2730.832).43
Although there are discrepancies,36,4449 the beneﬁts of engag-
ing in physical activities have also been seen in populations diag-
nosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. 

[CHUNK 22928]
Several
studies have found improvements in executive functions, memory,
and cognitive tests in individuals with MCI who engaged in an
aerobic exercise program.5055 Improvements in the cognitive
function of individuals with MCI through physical activity
are important in preventing the progression of the disease
and in decreasing the number of AD in older people. 

[CHUNK 22929]
In
individuals diagnosed with AD, and, in general, at early
stages of the disease, aerobic exercise alone, or accompa-
nied with cognitive stimulation, induces improvements in
some aspects of brain function,5665 although in some stud-
ies exercise was accompanied with cognitive situation.


[CHUNK 22930]
Few studies have been published on the effects of resistance
training in people with MCI or AD.44,6668 Prominent among
them is the randomized, double-blind trial that included 100
people between 55 and 86 years of age with MCI.69 In this
study it was shown that 6 months of resistance exercise
induced improvements in memory, attention, and executive
functions. 

[CHUNK 22931]
Moreover, those beneﬁts persisted 12 months after
the end of the intervention period.


[CHUNK 22932]
Prevention through the promotion of changes in lifestyle in
presymptomatic and predementia disease stages may have the
potential for delaying one-third of dementias.70 Engaging in
physical exercise programs seems to be effective, but it is
clearly not enough. 

[CHUNK 22933]
Studies that examine multimodal interven-
tions hypothesize that an integrated approach to addressing
multiple risk factors for AD may be more successful than sin-
gle-component interventions in producing beneﬁts. 

[CHUNK 22934]
Multi-
modal interventions often include changes in diet, physical
activity, and cognitive training (Fig. 

[CHUNK 22935]
1).


[CHUNK 22936]
Several studies attribute to the diet a key role in delaying
the progression of AD. 

[CHUNK 22937]
Some of these studies have tested diets
considered as heart-healthy, such as the Dietary Approaches to
Stop Hypertension diet (DASH), MediterraneanDASH Inter-
vention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND), or the
Mediterranean diet.71 The inﬂammatory component of AD has
been treated by supplementation with fatty acids, vitamins, ﬂa-
vonoids, polyphenols, probiotics, and dietary advanced glyca-
tion end products.72 Ketogenic diets, which are protective in
other neurological disorders, also seem to have great potential
in the prevention and treatment of the disease.73 In humans,

[CHUNK 22939]
Brain function in normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease is inﬂuenced
by lifestyle factors. 

[CHUNK 22940]
The usual trajectory for brain aging (orange line) indicates
that, years before death, an individual shows signs of mild cognitive
impairment. 

[CHUNK 22941]
In some cases, that cognitive damage takes place many years
before death and even leads to dementia (red line). 

[CHUNK 22942]
By modifying lifestyle fac-
tors through multimodal interventions, an individual can delay the onset of
cognitive impairment until a very advanced age (green line).


[CHUNK 22943]
396
A. De la Rosa et al.


[CHUNK 22944]
few clinical trials have been carried out using ketogenic diets;
instead, ketogenic agents have been used.74 In animal models
of AD, the increase in ketone levels in the body through inter-
mittent fasting or supplementation with ketone esters have
shown promising results.75,76
The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive
Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a multidomain interven-
tion consisting of diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular
risk monitoring, resulted in an improvement or maintenance of
cognitive functioning in at-risk elderly people from the general
population.77 This trial was the ﬁrst methodologically robust
study showing that with a 2-year intervention, it was possible to
reduce the risk of cognitive decline among the general elderly
population, rather than solely with patients in a clinical setting.


[CHUNK 22945]
More recently, it has been found that engaging in physical activ-
ity and lowering vascular risk may have additive protective
effects on delaying the progression of AD.22 Greater physical
activity and lower vascular risk independently attenuated the
negative association of Ab burden with cognitive decline and
neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals.78

[CHUNK 22946]
Potential protective mechanisms of physical exercise on
brain aging, from mice to humans
The beneﬁcial effects of physical activity go beyond skele-
tal muscle and involve adaptations in other organs. 

[CHUNK 22947]
Exercise
causes changes in the brain at the anatomic, cellular, and
molecular levels by inducing a cascade of cellular and molecu-
lar processes that promote different physiologic phenomena,
including angiogenesis, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and
stimulation of neurotrophic factors that enhance learning,
memory, and brain plasticity (Fig. 

[CHUNK 22948]
2).53,60,7984 The availabil-
ity of transgenic murine models that simulate the main neuro-
pathologic characteristics of AD has enabled the study of the
main protective mechanisms of exercise on brain aging.


[CHUNK 22949]
Among these mechanisms is an increase in cerebral blood ﬂow
(CBF) in several cortical and subcortical areas,85 together with
the decrease in the formation of Ab and the phosphorylation
of the tau protein.86,87

[CHUNK 22950]
Summary of the main mechanisms that exercise can
activate at the brain level
5.1. b-Amyloid peptide, tau protein, and exercise
In transgenic mice models for AD, a decrease in Ab plaques
and NFTs after both voluntary and forced exercise interventions
has been found. 

[CHUNK 22951]
In some cases, these ﬁndings have been accom-
panied by improvements in learning and memory.8689 APP/
PS1 are double transgenic mice expressing a chimeric mouse/
human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Mo/HuAPP695swe)
and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1-dE9), both directed to
central nervous system (CNS) neurons. 

[CHUNK 22952]
In a recent study in dou-
ble transgenic APPswe/PSEN1DE9 mice, 10 weeks of voluntary
exercise decreased both the load and the size of the Ab plaques,
as well as the phosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus.


[CHUNK 22953]
Improvements in spatial memory, a decrease in hippocampal
neuronal loss, and an increase in neurogenesis in the Cornu
Ammonis 3 (CA3) zone and the dentate gyrus were also reported
in the study.90 These results have been supported by studies in
other AD transgenic mice models such as hPS2m (overexpress
human Presenilin 2 mutant),89 Tg-NSE/htau23 (overexpress
human tau23 under the control of the NSE promoter),88 Thy-
Tau22 (human 4-repeat tau mutated at sites G272V and P301S
under the control of Thy1.2 promoter),91 P301S-tau (overexpress
the P301S-mutant human tau gene),87 and Tg2576 (overexpress
human APP 695).92 It is assumed that a successful therapy for
AD would both remove the pathologic hallmarks of the disease
and provide some functional recovery. 

[CHUNK 22954]
However, there are stud-
ies that have not found a decrease in Ab load and/or tau phos-
phorylation despite improvements in learning tasks and/or
memory in the exercised mice.9395 A key factor with exercise
interventions is to start them in an early pathologic state. 

[CHUNK 22955]
Exer-
cise cannot counteract the formation of plaques and the cognitive
deterioration if the intervention is carried out after their appear-
ance.86 Moreover, it has been shown in mice models that volun-
tary exercise may be superior to forced exercise if certain
aspects of the disease, such as plaque deposition and memory
impairment, are to be reduced.92
Studies in humans have also found an inverse correlation
between physical activity levels and the plasma and brain
Ab load in elderly people without cognitive disorders.96,97
Moreover, it has been found that a 6-month aerobic exercise
intervention
in
individuals
with
MCI
induced
a
24%
decrease in the plasma Ab1-42 levels when compared with
the levels found in the control group.50 Jointly, all of these
results indicate a potential role of exercise in modulating
the Ab turnover.

Exercise in Alzheimer’s disease
397


[CHUNK 22962]
characterized by a relative decline in adaptive immunity and
T-helper 2 responses and is associated with increased cell-
mediated responses.98 Inﬂammaging has been considered to be
a “prodrome” to AD and microglial malfunction, a common
feature during aging.99
Exercise has important modulatory effects on immune func-
tion.100 Systemically, physical exercise has been shown to
have a positive effect on markers of inﬂammation, and recently
those effects have been extended to the CNS.101
In the Tg2576 AD animal model, it was shown that 3 weeks
of voluntary exercise were sufﬁcient to decrease the concentra-
tion of Ab and the proinﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-1b
(IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). 

[CHUNK 22963]
These changes
were accompanied by an increase in proteins related to the
immune response, such as interferon-g and macrophage
inﬂammatory protein-1a, in the hippocampus.102
The anti-inﬂammatory effects of exercise on the CNS have
also been evaluated in older animals. 

[CHUNK 22964]
Higher levels of hippo-
campal IL-10 (the main anti-inﬂammatory cytokine) and lower
IL-1b/IL-10, IL-6/IL-10, and TNF-a/IL-10 ratios have been
found in rats exercised for 10 days.103 Barrientos et al.104
found that the long-term memory impairment in older rats
injected with Escherichia coli (E. coli) intraperitoneally could
be prevented when they had free access to running wheels.


[CHUNK 22965]
Along with these ﬁndings, voluntary exercise also prevented
the reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
expression in the CA1 zone of the hippocampus. 

[CHUNK 22966]
Finally,
the microglia of the exercised rats had a lower inﬂamma-
tory response than the control rats, as measured by the
expression of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6. 

[CHUNK 22967]
These ﬁndings high-
light the capacity of exercise to modulate inﬂammatory
responses on CNS and reinforce its potential in minimizing
the risk of suffering diseases related to neuroinﬂammation,
such as AD.


[CHUNK 22968]
Particularly in elderly people, regular physical activity has
been shown to have a positive effect in the reduction of inﬂamma-
tory markers such as Creaction protein, IL-6, and TNF-a105110
at the systemic level. 

[CHUNK 22969]
In many cases, this has been associated with
better performance in cognitive tests in both cross-sectional111113
and longitudinal studies.114117
Aerobic exercise lasting more than 2 weeks118121 has been
shown to improve the immune system in healthy elderly peo-
ple by increasing the activity of the natural killer cells, the pro-
liferation of T lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, and
endothelial progenitor cells. 

[CHUNK 22970]
However, it is noteworthy that the
results achieved with resistance exercise interventions have
been more heterogeneous.122
5.3. 

[CHUNK 22971]
Neurotrophins, cognitive function, and exercise
Neurotrophins are growth factors belonging to the family of
neurotrophic factors, which regulate axonal growth, synaptic
plasticity, neurotransmission, hippocampal neurogenesis, syn-
aptic protein expression, and long-term potentiation.123128
Among neurotrophins, BDNF has been extensively studied,
and its relationship with exercise and cognitive function has
been widely established.32,50,129135 The brain synthesizes
about 75% of BDNF under normal conditions. 

[CHUNK 22972]
During pro-
longed exercise, this synthesis is increased by 2- to 3-fold, and
there is evidence indicating that circulating BDNF levels cor-
relate with brain tissue BDNF levels.132,136
Exercise
provides
cognitive
beneﬁt
in
5xFAD
mice
(express human APP and PSEN1 transgenes with a total of 5
AD-linked mutations: the Swedish (K670N/M671L), Florida
(I716V), and London (V717I) mutations in APP, and the
M146L and L286V mutations in PSEN1), a mouse model of
AD, by inducing both adult hippocampal neurogenesis and
by elevating the levels of BDNF.137 This combination seems
to generate an adequate brain environment for the mainte-
nance and survival of the new neurons in regions of the brain
affected by AD. 

[CHUNK 22973]
The induction of adult hippocampal neuro-
genesis in combination with the elevation of BDNF levels
successfully mimic the beneﬁcial effects of exercise in AD
mice.137 However, the induction of hippocampal neurogenesis
alone did not beneﬁt cognition or AD markers. 

[CHUNK 22974]
Exercise has
also shown its effectiveness on cognitive function and BDNF
levels in mice models of accelerated aging.130 Four weeks of
moderate exercise were sufﬁcient to improve recognition
memory and increased hippocampal BDNF expression in
13-month-old mice.


[CHUNK 22975]
Low levels of BDNF have been found in brains of people
with AD,138,139 which supports the hypothesis that improving
its production may be an effective alternative that delays the
onset of the disease. 

[CHUNK 22976]
In humans, several studies indicate that
both acute and chronic exercise140146 contribute to an
increase in the peripheral levels of BDNF, and, in some cases,
it is related to gains in cognitive function.131,147149 Moreover,
aerobic exercise-induced increments in hippocampal volume
are associated with greater serum levels of BDNF in cogni-
tively healthy older individuals,33 and high serum levels of
BDNF have been associated with low risk of AD.150
The pathways responsible for the synthesis and release of
BDNF in AD patients seem to be susceptible to stimulation
with exercise. 

[CHUNK 22977]
In fact, one bout of acute aerobic exercise
increased the BDNF plasma levels in patients with AD and in
healthy controls. 

[CHUNK 22978]
Additionally, BDNF was associated with
their physical activity levels.151
5.4. 

[CHUNK 22979]
AD, CBF, and exercise
Aging has been associated with progressive losses in cogni-
tive function and CBF.152156 It has been shown that the rate
of decrease with age of the CBF is 0.35%0.45% per year in
middle-aged and elderly subjects (Fig. 

[CHUNK 22980]
3).157,158 This leads to
an accelerated decline in cognitive function and an increased
risk of suffering dementia in the general population.159
Although the cause of the CBF decrease in aging is not
entirely clear, it has been postulated that changes in the density
and elasticity of cerebral blood vessels, as well as the degener-
ation of pericytes and a reduction in the activity and number of
neurons, could explain it.161,162
Compared with healthy people, individuals with AD show
a decrease of up to 40% in the CBF. 

[CHUNK 22981]
Regions such as the
precuneus, the hippocampus, the posterior cingulate gyrus,
398
A. De la Rosa et al.


[CHUNK 22982]
and the temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes are mainly
affected.163167
In animal models, it has been shown that the soluble form
of Ab protein can accumulate in cerebral blood vessels (which
is known as amyloid angiopathy), generating a decrease in
CBF and a vasoconstriction effect, possibly affecting neuronal
activity.168,169 Intra-arterially injected solubilized Ab1-40 in
rats of 78 months of age decreased CBF and increased vascu-
lar resistance in the cerebral cortex of the animals, indicating
that Ab could contribute to the hypoperfusion observed during
AD.170
In older adults, the regular practice of exercise has a positive
effect both on peripheral endothelial function171 and on the
increase of CBF in areas such as the hippocampus.156,172,173 In
middle-aged, cognitively healthy subjects, even short-term exer-
cise programs, such as 3 h of aerobic exercise per week for 12
weeks, are sufﬁcient to improve CBF at rest in regions such as the
anterior cingulate and the hippocampus.174,175 However, even in
physically active people, short periods of inactivity can decrease
CBF in up to 8 regions of the brain, including the hippocampus.176
Thus, CBF is sensitive to small changes in people’s lifestyle, thus
making it necessary to maintain a regular practice of exercise to
preserve brain health.


[CHUNK 22983]
Regarding AD patients and exercise, the results from
studies have not been consistent.177 For instance, in a study,
exercise did not lead to any improvements in CBF,178 concen-
trations of Ab, total tau, or phosphorylated tau in the cerebro-
spinal ﬂuid of people with AD.179 This indicates that, although
functional parameters are still likely to be positively affected
in people with AD, changes in brain function may require an
adjustment in the different components of the load, such as the
duration of exercise sessions and the frequency, intensity, and
type of exercise during the intervention.


[CHUNK 22984]
Finding mimetics of physical exercise for those patients
who have very compromised functionality is not easy, because
physical exercise is a very systemic intervention and targets at
several potential causes of AD. 

[CHUNK 22985]
The possibility of using molec-
ular mimetics, such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribo-
nucleotide (AICAR), is known to only improve brain function
transiently180 and does not achieve the same positive effects
as, for instance, running. 

[CHUNK 22986]
Another option would be to use neu-
romuscular electrical stimulation or vibration in people who
are unable to perform physical exercise, but this has not yet
been tested in AD patients.181
6. 

[CHUNK 22987]
Conclusion
Promoting changes in lifestyle in presymptomatic and pre-
dementia disease stages may have the potential for delaying
one-third of dementias worldwide. 

[CHUNK 22988]
Exercise modulates Ab
turnover, inﬂammation, the synthesis and release of neurotro-
phins, and CBF. 

[CHUNK 22989]
Multimodal interventions that include the
adoption of an active lifestyle should be recommended for
older populations.
